Narazaki 1 explains that Hasui depicted the picturesque scenery of Senjo cliff before.

Opposite is the bizarrely shaped cliff at Senjo, hemmed with autumnal foliage.  The surface of the lake is serene, thereflection of the Senjo cliff on the water, upon which a single white-sailed boat is afloat, is effective. There are two versions of this picture.

The Great Lantern at the Asakusa Kannondo 1934; from a limited edition (first edition) of 100 Woodblock, 360 x 240 mm (image).
The “Kannon Hall” is part of the Sensoji Temple in Asakusa, a fairly Bohemian district of Tokyo before the Second World War.  It is famous for its huge paper lantern, of which Hiroshige had done a celebrated print in his One Hundred Views of Edo in the late 1850s.  Shiro’s view is similarly constructed to Hiroshige’s, but its rather pessimistic, dark atmosphere is noticeably different from the early master’s cheerful and light-filled version.  As often in this artist’s work, the figures have their back to us.

The enormously popular Asakusa Kannon Temple (also known as Senso Temple) in Tokyo’s Asakusa district figures prominently in the traditional annual calendar of events and festivals, especially during the temple visits at the New Year which attract large crowds.

This dynamic image was included in a series of twelve prints published around 1923...1 This print has been previously attributed to the writer Morita Sōhie (1881-1949).  However, although Morita Sohei was acquainted with a number of shin hanga artists such as Natori Shunsen, it is doubtful that he himself designed prints.  The style of this print and part of the signature is instead similar to a print by the little-known artist, Yamaguchi Sōhei, entitled Memorial portrait of the actor Nakamura Ganjiro, which was published by the Osaka publisher, Yamagiya, in 1935.

Ariko no Naishi (A.D. 829-900), a lady in waiting in the Heian court, is despondent over an unrequited love. As she prepares to jump from the boat and drown herself, she recites the following verse, How hopeless it is; it would be better for me to sink beneath the waves; perhaps then I could see my man from Moon Capital.

Source: Yoshitoshi's One Hundred Aspects of the Moon, John Stevenson, Hotei Publishing, Netherlands 2001.
This is one of the most charming designs of the series. The moon is shown only in reflection -- the printer's execution of this concept is excellent. In addition to wiping away her tears with a poignant gesture, Ariko seems also to be shadingthem from the brilliance of the reflected moonlight. The design was a favorite of the writer and critic Noguchi Yone; in a lecture to the London Japan Society in 1914, he described pasting an impression of this print on a screen and his pleasure whenever he looked at it.

The black of Ariko’s robes has been burnished with a piece of ivory, giving it a shiny finish.  The design on the robe is made up of large wheels and stylized vine leaves, probably morning-glories, in a colorful tie-dyed pattern.  (The wheel, associated with the Buddhist concept of the Wheel of Life, was a common religious motif in Japan; as a means of transport, however, wheels were impractical and little used in Japan’shilly countryside, where objects and people were more usually carried –during the time of Lady Ariko they were most commonly used on the oxcarts of the aristocracy.)  A design of small wheels over waves was popular in the Heian period (794-1185), but the oversize wheels here seem more appropriate for a kimono pattern of the Edo period(1600-1868).  Perhaps a kimono design with waves would have seemed excessive for a print where waves are the most important element of the composition.  Most of the bottom half of the design is devoted to the water, which has the effect of drawing the figure downwards.  The waves are choppy, blown by a cool breeze that, if we stop for a moment, wecan almost feel and hear.

Source: Terrific Tokyo – A Panorama in Prints from the 1860s to the 1930s, Elizabeth de Sabato Swinton, Worcester Art Museum, 1998, p. 47.
Factory Streets at Honjo first appeared in One Hundred Views of the New Tokyo (Shin Tokyo Hyakkei), published between 1929 and 1932.  This series captured the city that arose in the wake of the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923.  Published by the Takujo group, the series’ artists were all members of the Japan Creative Print Association.  Immediately after World War II, Scenes of Last Tokyo, an album of fifteen prints, appeared.  This print was one of the eight from the earlier series but was not printed from the original blocks  but from new ones cut from the earlier prints.  The print was re-titled in English Fakutory [sic] Street at Fukagawa for this 1945 series.

The artists had agreed to allow reissuing the prints for sale at the U.S. Army Post Exchange in Tokyo.  Due to shortages after the war, the paper is quite different from that used for the originals, and the effect is consequently flatter and less vibrant than in the first state.

Honjo, east of the Sumida River, was designated as one of Tokyo’s industrial wards during the Meiji period.  The writer Akutagawa Ryunosuke (1892-1927), who grew up in Hongo, described it in an essay written after the earthquake as “not the region of factories that it is today” but a city of ghosts.  Situated across the river from Asakusa, it was after 1923 one of the poorest sections of the city.  Maekawa catches the bleakness of this factory area, full of smokestacks and utility poles, with overall-clad factory workers trudging up the road.  The seedily romantic quality of Akutagawa’s boyhood has been replaced by the harsh ugliness of industrialization.

This design was re-utilized from the original (1929) in the series One Hundred Views of New Tokyo (Shin Tokyo hyakkei). The blocks were re-cut, and there are many small differences of detail, but the more important difference is in the fresher colours, which rather ameliorate the sombre proletarian atmosphere of Maekawa's earlier version. In contrast to most of the views in this portfolio, this one had a genuine nostalgia, since this area of industrial Tokyo had been almost completely obliterated in the American air-raids (in Seidensticker, Edward, 'Tokyo Rising: The City Since the Great Earthquake', New York, 1990, it is stated that the population of Honjo fell to 4 percent of its February 1944 population by June 1945(pp. 144-5)). Hacker's photograph of a street dance (below) shows industrial-type buildings of a similar style to those in this print.

Near Sauhoku, the Japanese encountered a Chinese offensive of elite forces from Manchuria, whose gallantry was legendary. Until then the Chinese had been either on the defensive or in flight, as stated in a Japanese report on this unusual battle: ""Up to now the enemy's customary tactic was defense. This time they pretend to take the offensive. It was bizarre. Unlike in the past, they attacked ferociously. We were outnumbered. Like an army of rats and dogs they used a hit-and-run strategy but were no match for the Japanese forces under General Tatsumi, who had a devil's wisdom and a god's bravery."" 

These Manchurian horsemen played both sides during the war, often working for the side that offered then the most.  There was a thin line between their operating as guerrilla fighters for one side or the other and their operating as bandits (honghuzi).  These bands continued operating through the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) as can be seen this collection's print IHL Cat. #1224 Telegraphic Record of the Russo-Japanese War: Manchurian Mounted Bandits Destroy Railroad.

It was the most dramatic episode of the war, and nothing was wanting to enhance its spectacular effect.  The hills encircling the bay formed a gigantic amphitheater from which the vicissitudes of the struggle could be observed.  Military attaches and men-of-war of the principal navies of the world followed with intense curiosity all the operations, and the Japanese, conscious that they were acting before a gallery of nations, determined to display, day after day, all the resources of their skill and daring.  In a few days the Japanese exhibited all the methods of modern warfare by land and ships, daring torpedo attacks which strewed the harbor with sunken hulls.  The Japanese never relaxed their relentless hold on the foredoomed fleet until the inevitable surrender came.

The 2nd army, still under Oyama, had undertaken operations against Wei-hai-wei, the second great fortress and dockyard of northern China, where Admiral Ting's squadron had been refitting since the battle of the Yalii; and it was hoped that both armies would accomplish their present tasks in time to advance in the summer against Peking itself. On the 18th of January a naval demonstration was made at Teng-chow-fu, 70 in. west of Wei-hai-wei, and on the eighth the Japanese began their disembarkation at Yung-cheng Bay, about 12 m. from Wei-hai-wei. The landing was scarcely opposed, and on the 26th the Japanese advance was begun. The south-eastern defenses of Wei-hai-wei harbor were carried by the 6th division, whilst the 2nd division reached the inner waters of the bay, driving the Chinese before them. The fleet under Ito co-operated effectively. On the night of the 4th-5th of February the Chinese squadron in harbor was attacked by ten torpedo boats. Two boats were lost, but the armor-clad ""Ting-Yuen"" was sunk. On the following night a second attack was made, and three more vessels were sunk. On the 9th the ""Ching-Yuen"" was sunk by the guns in one of the captured forts. On the 12th Admiral Ting wrote to Admiral Ito offering to surrender, and then took poison, other officers following his example. Wei-hai-wei was then dismantled by the Japanese, who recovered the remnant of the Chinese squadron, including the ""Chen Yuen,"" [Chinen] and the 2nd army concentrated at Port Arthur for the advance on Peking.",,Tsunajima Kamekichi 綱島亀吉seal of the Tsujiokaya Kamekichi辻岡屋亀吉[Marks: pub. ref. 549; seal not shown],second generation Watanabe Horiei 二世 渡辺彫栄,n.a.,,,February 1895 (Meiji 28),Impression excellent,Colors excellent - with application of gofun for snow effect.,"Condition good - trimmed into the image, backed, panels joined, center fold center panel (slight separation at edges), minor color offsetting",Genre ukiyo-e;senso-e (Sino-Japanese War),Format vertical ōban triptych,,H x W Paper 14 x 27 7/8 in.

Though anecdotal and in a style that had lost popularity in Europe, it is curiously moving, precisely because of Toshihide’s ability to convey at once the grief and dignity of the defeated man.  Defeat, not victory, is the theme of most of the medieval Japanese war tales, and the heroes of Japanese history are mainly failed heroes.

This quick turnaround was made possible by the artist’s re-use of a woodblock originally used to depict a battle from the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-5 in which Japan struggled to overtake Taiwan and the Pescadores.

They had paralyzed and bottled up the Russian Port Arthur squadron since February 8.  The great Russian Admiral Makarov managed to leave port and gave pursuit, but on his way back to port, as both the English and Japanese captions relate:



The Japanese navy lay unchallenged off of Port Arthur.

The Japanese admiration of the Russian admiral is apparent in his defiant posture as he goes down with his ship.  By emphasizing Makarov's heroism, the artist glorifies Japan as the victor over so formidable an enemy and as a power worthy of respect.

Lake Chuzenji is a view of the famous mountain lake that lies at the southern foot of Mt.. Nantai.  It is named after Chuzenji Temple founded by Shodo in 784, which must be the red building visible to the far right.

The Play - Kochō (The Butterfly)
Source: A Guide to No, P.G. O'Neill, Hinoki Shoten, 1929, p. 81.

A priest visiting the capital is admiring some beautiful plum blossom in the rounds of a palace there, when a woman unexpectedly appears beside him.  She tells the priest that she is in reality a butterfly and speaks of her regret that, although she can enjoy all the flowers that bloom in the other seasons, those of the plum which come in early spring are denied to her.  She asks for the priest's prayers to help her to attain salvation and then disappears.  That night, when the priest is resting beneath the tree, he sees the spirit of the butterfly perform a joyful dance because salvation has been made possible, and then watches it disappear again into the mist.

He was hit, but urged his men forward, until he was killed by a second bullet.  It was not the gallant officer, however, but his bugler Shirakami Genjiro1, who died blowing the charge, who became the first national hero of the campaign.

Toshikata includes all the details that convey the samurai spirit of the modern warrior.  Advancing under heavy fire, undaunted by personal danger, Matsuzaki charged ahead of his men.  The nighttime sky, lit by a crescent moon, heightens the pathos of the hero's bravery and death.

In this print the emperor himself is not pictured.

According to Donald Keene1, the emperor was not in a rush to return to Tokyo from Kyoto2: ""[W]hen it was announced that the imperial headquarters would move back to Tokyo on May 29, he resisted leaving, saying that some major figures in the victory over China had not yet had their triumphal return.  But when the last of the heroes of the war had returned in triumph, there was no longer any excuse for remaining in Kyoto, and the emperor left for Tokyo on May 29.""

""He arrived at Shinbashi Station on the thirtieth, in military dress as usual, and paraded through a garishly decorated city that was packed with huge throngs of people.  Tokyo’s citizens put out national flags and decorative lanterns in front of their houses and filled the streets with banners, streamers, and arches of many kinds.  The most striking temporary monument for the city was a huge “triumphal arcade,” widely touted as having no equal in any country, which was constructed at Hibiya between the official residences of the presidents of the two Diet houses.  So large was this arcade - 110 meters long and 18 meters in height, with a main tower over 30 meters high and 8 meters wide – that the city government reportedly put one thousand laborers to work to widen Saiwaichō Avenue on which it was constructed.  The Tokyo City Assembly also built two other great triumphal arches, one each at Shinbashi and Sakuradamon, both of which were thirty-three meters high and over three meters thick.""3

""Kitaoka’s Fishing Village in the Afternoon is a model of layered color, technique, and meaning.  Kitaoka presents his village street inthe strong light of the high-noon hour.  The wash of the direct light,enhanced with a sheen of luminescent mica, is beautifully accented with splashes of orange and blue in the receding background and the cuddled mass of a yellow dog in the lower right corner.  Using Westernperspective methods and Eastern printing expertise, the print beautifully captures an accurately observed moment.  There is a timelessness to the image; the space depicted is a working man’village, a seaside community with worn streets and lived-in houses. Portraying an identifiable setting, moment, and mood, all executed with complete artistic control and mastery, Kitaoka’s print is the paradigm of woodblock printing at its best and is a visually stunning exercise in expressive realism.""

""In addition to imparting a sense of calm, prints in Grott’s collection also offer a view of Japanese life not often seen.  One such example isa 1966 print by Kitaoka Fumio (1918–2007) entitled Fishing Village in the Afternoon.  It shows a deserted street occupied only by one seated person and a yellow dog sleeping in the sun.  Grott enjoys the subtle colors used in the print, but grows serious when he describes the sense.  'It is not a wealthy area,' he observes.  'There is an unusual metal tower and a ramshackle roof that looks like it’s about to fall down.  Life’s not so great for people who have to do this type of work.'

""Hara has been working with the theme of 'strokes' since the 1970s. The strokes are paths of light, each one a range of intensities captured by Hara's magnificent technique of colour gradation.""1  His prints, exhibiting ""flat coolness and perfect evenness""2 at first appear to be silkscreens, but they are achieved through lithography ""often involving many different printings""3 using the artist's ""special technique with a method of applying the ink with huge rollers to give his work an element of unbelievable smoothness, lushness, and control.""4

I was immediately drawn to Hara's work when it first came to my attention in 2007, seeing its indebtedness to traditional Japanese calligraphy in its movement while substituting a rainbow of saturated colors for the traditional black sumi ink. I find Hara's work cerebral, calming and continually interesting.

For this 1980 print, Hara has softened his usual white background with the addition of a subtle cream color which allows the strokes to float off the page.

""Beginning in the mid-sixties, a white space appeared around the motif reminiscent of the blank areas in ink painting.  In the seventies this margin was even more evident, enhancing the light,bright qualities of the print.   In the seventies, this marginal spacecame to have more obvious structural features.  First, a rigidly square geometric form emerged..often surrounded by empty space.  These forms first appeared in the Niwa series which was based on Kyoto motif, so I would guess that the square represented a walled garden.  If so, the delicate lines and planes,which cluster around the square like theatrical props, probably indicate trees, ponds, and rock formations in the garden.  This Impression is reinforced by an amorphous form reminiscent of a single Chinese character made with heavy brush strokes which is placed under the square.  It creates a balanced contrast with the square above it. I see it as a symbol of the living, bustling city outside the enclosed garden.  This composition of a square and a ideograph was repeated in a series of prints and became a definite structural pattern inTakahashi’s work.""

James Michener refers to Masaji's prints as ""mysterious"" in nature and divides his work into ""four clear categories.""  Novel Growth No. 2 falls into the third category, as described by Michener, as follows:

Masaji’s third kind of print formed a radical departure and was occasioned, as such new forms ought to be, by a personal crisis within the conscience of the artist.  The prints appear mostly in purple and black and always with a swarm of closely knit lines…  The designs are tortured, involuted, brooding, and the mysterious colors effectively represent the spirit of the work.  These are most distinguished prints, not widely favored by collectors but cherished by those who know the artist and who are concerned with the artistic problems inherent in the modern school of woodblock prints.  What dark experience of the soul called forth this series I do not know, but during its issue Masaji’s son died, and the prints from a fitting memorial to this tragedy, although they were not originally called forth by it.  Connoisseurs of the exquisite in art should know these prints, for they are some of the most expert issued in Japan, veritable masterpieces of printing and color.  They exhibit no quick allure and one comes to them quietly after having known other prints that on the surface are much more enticing; but when one has discovered their quiet mastery one recognizes in them a milestone in contemporary Japanese woodblocks.

In the foreground is a stall selling sushi (a dish of cold rice, fish or vegetables and seaweed), and in the middle ground a lantern advertising the spring theater performances.  The background is filled by the very typical between-the-Wars buildings of the Tokyo entertainment area.  Among these inanimate features the people, in a mixture of Western and Japanese dress, seem shadowy and uncertain.  Shiro was in the 1930s very sensitive to this introverted atmosphere and has recorded it with a poetic skill which he never regained after the catastrophe of the War. 

Source: Printed to Perfection: Twentieth-century Japanese Prints from the Robert O. Muller Collection, Amy Reigle Newland, et. al., Hotei Publishing, 2004, p. 113.
This piece stands as one of Shiro’s most delightful designs: a view of the bustling Ginza district in Tokyo during the 1930s, with a street side food stall to the left, and on the right a large advertisement for the traditional geisha dance, azuma odori (literally, “dance of the Eastern Capital [Tokyo]”).  Alexandra Marmion suggests that in his prints Shiro attempts to poeticize, or “Edocize,” the most aggressively modern district of Tokyo by eliminating any reference to modern culture and defining the subject through elements with romantic, nostalgic connotations – the blossoming cherry tree, the food stall, and the reference to Edo in the advertisement.

Shiro was particularly adept at suggesting nuances of weather and atmosphere of specific times and places.  In ""Spring Night - Ginza,"" 1934, he provides a nostalgic glimpse of the Ginza of budding willows and soft lights before it became a carnival of flashing neon.  The picturesque food stand, the signs, and the strolling people are all infused with the magic of the still night air.

Before the Great Kanto Earthquake (1923), only the northern part of present-day Ginza was known by that name.  During the 1920s, it grew into a major entertainment area, and the number of drinking places doubled.  Sarari-man (salary-men, white-collar workers) flocked to its bars, cafes, dance halls, and cabarets. 

Kasamatsu Shiro depicts Ginza on a mild spring night when the new leaves are just opening on the area's famous willow trees.  The artist's use of blue to suggest the color of night when it is illuminated by street lamps and signs is quite lyrical.  Crowds of men and women, well dressed in both Japanese and Western clothing, fill the streets.  The dancers in the round dance hall at the upper right are silhouetted by the interior lighting.  A man stands within the closed curtain of the sushi bar at the lower left.  The lighted sign of a soba (noodle) shop down the street is easily read.  Men on their way home from a night of drinking or the theater would pop into places like this for a quick bite to eat.  Images such as this one surely inspired the use of the name Ginza for busy shopping and entertainment areas throughout the country.",,Watanabe Shōzaburō seal reading ワタナベ Watanabe [Marks: seal 08-034; pub. ref. 576],,,,,"of original publication in lower right margin昭和九年四月 April 1934(see ""Edition"" below)",Impression excellent,Colors good,Condition good - minor mat burn; slight overall toning; slight color fading; brown tape top center verso; shallow two inch fold 1/3 down from top,Genre shin hanga,Format horizontal ōban,H x W Image 14 1/4 x 9 3/8 in.

""Paper pulp was also an ideal medium for his experiments. Wetness to perfection. Pulp is strong and durable and yet it is able to take on three dimensional form and hold foreign objects in its grasp, even bond with antique fabrics.

At 7:25 AM Major General Oshima Yoshimasa rode out with great dignity to the gate to meet his assembled troops.  The king’s envoy was the first to laud the victorious troops, expressing the king’s pleasure at their achievements.  The general replied solemnly and briefly.   Minister Otori’s speech came next, followed by shouts of ‘Banzai for His Imperial Majesty!’ which rose from the crowd.

Depiction of Japan as a Dragonfly
Japan was not always named Japan. Japanese legend has it that an Emperor was bitten by a horsefly which, in turn, was eaten by a dragonfly.

""A bearded Japanese officer is juggling with six small pig-tailed Chinese men in the form of dolls. To show how easy it is to defeat the Chinese. A young bugler provides music for the act. ""

In commenting on Kiyochika's samurai background and his contempt for the enemy and the racist depictions of the defeated Chinese foe, Baten comments:
The print is an interesting one for our study because the officer is playing a popular children's game called  o-jamma  (or  ote-dama ), which involves throwing small rag dolls or bags stuffed with peas, rice, or grain in the air and catching It is not surprising that the Chinese were mocked, for a Japanese samurai's highest aspirations were to be indifferent to suffering and to die for his master without hesitation. in his book  Homo Ludens,  ""The Japanese samurai held the view that what was serious for the common man was but a game for the valiant.""",,Matsuki Heikichi (松木平吉) proprietor of Daikokuya,,,,,June 1895 (Meiji 28),Impression excellent,Colors good,"Condition poor - soiling and wrinkling throughout; ½” wide vertical fold, full margins, not backed",Genre ukiyo-e - senso-e (Sino-Japanese War); giga;fūshiga,Format vertical ōban,H x W Image 13 7/8 x 9 3/8 in.

It is always fascinating to look at an artist's proof print (IHL Cat. #2240) and the final edition of the print (IHL Cat. #238). While the editioned version is of very poor quality with severe toning and horizontal and vertical ""burn"" marks on the paper, we can see that the biggest change from the artist proof to the editioned print was the addition of the orange markings in the lower right of the print. 

Created the year following Takahashi's 1963 visit to the United States, this print captures the feel of the Greenwich Village jazz scene in the early 60s.

Kyotohas been the predominant theme of Takahashi's work.  Kyoto, eithernamed or referenced in the print title, appears in a total ofsixty-three of the artists prints, spanning almost his entire career.

""Kyoto,former capital of Japan, is the focus of Takahashi's artisticinspiration, a city to which this artist remains profoundlyattached.... Despite its size, it has an intimacy, an accessible charmto which Takahashi has yielded completely.""

In discussing this print, Kyoto's Voice, Petit states, ""Simplicity is a keynote in Takahashi's works, yet it, too, conveys more than a mere freedom from complexity or an absence of pretentiousness.  One could even go so far as to describe it as the unity of that which has no form.  The lightly embossed print shown here speaks of Zen gardens under snow, glittering in the void.  It is a distillation of the spirit of Kyoto, whose restraint and elegance are epitomized in its gardens.""",,self-published,,,,,1964,Impression excellent,Colors excellent,"Condition fair – overall toning; paper brittle, soft handling creases, masking tape remnants verso on 4 margins, 2.5” tear from paper edge upper left margin into image",Genre sōsaku hanga,n.a.,H x W Image 37 1/4 x 25 in.

Smith.  Domestic prints were similar to traditional bird and flower prints (kacho-e) but showed domestic everyday house and garden scenes.  In this print Kiyochika has sought to approximate Western-style painting, eliminating the margins to approximate a canvas.  (Note this collection's print has had margins added to it and it appears that the Los Angeles County Museum of Art print may also have added margins.) 

While absent from both this collection's print and the print in the collection of the Chazen Museum of Art, the prints in the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art both have the publisher's name and publication date in the bottom left and center portion of the image, as shown below. Kiyochika's signature is present on all prints along the lower right of the image.

Kiyochika' has made an effort to de-emphasize line in this print without abandoning the woodblock medium.  It is suggested that this print was designed to compete with the new technology of color lithography.  Particularly effective is the ghostly gray pattern of the decaying lotus in the background.  The careful modeling of the ducks suggests that the artist had observed such birds closely and was aiming more for a scientific Audubon-like accuracy than for the elegance of the traditional bird-and-flower genre.

One of 118 prints in the series Dai Nippon Bussan Zue (Products of Greater Japan), issued in August 1877 to coincide with the opening of Japan’s first National Industrial Exposition (Naikoku Kangyō Hakurankai) held in Tokyo’s Ueno Park. In this print, the Asian black bear (note the white chest mark) is being hunted for his gall.  Kaga Province (加賀国, Kaga no kuni) was an old province in the area that is today the southern part of Ishikawa Prefecture. Ruled by the Maeda clan, the capital of Kaga was Kanazawa. Kaga bordered on Echizen, Etchū, Hida, and Noto Provinces. It was part of Hokurikudō Circuit.1

The artist based many of his designs on the designs that appeared in the 1799 book Nihon Sankai Meisan Zue (Famous Sea and Land Products in Japan), leaving some question whether everything Hiroshige III portrayed in the series was truly the ""state of the art"" or, as in the case of this print, practiced in the same manner in 1877 when the series was issued. (Although for many activities pictured, things wouldhave looked much the same in 1877 as in 1799.) In many cases, the information in the scroll is also copied from the earlier work.","IHL Cat. #272: This print carries a number written in Kanji in the left margin, part of which has been trimmed.

",Shūkō 秋香,Shūkō 秋香,"On September 26, 1894, the Japanese imperial headquarters had organized the Second Army.  Its objective was to conquer the Chinese dockyard and arsenal of Port Arthur and then to embark on a campaign into the Peking region after winter.  On October 24, while the First Army was crossing the Yalu River and entering China, the Second Army landed on on the Liaotung (Chinchou) Peninsula.  By November 3, the Second Army advanced toward Chinchou, the major stronghold before Port Arthur.  With a full-scale assault on November 6, the Second Army broke the stiff resistance at Chinchou, taking the fortress before noon.

Twenty-five-year-old Nanbu Kijiro, a second artillery lieutenant (better known as the inventor of the Nanbu rifle and machine gun), described what he saw as platoon commander of the Third Mountain Artillery Battalion during the battle of Chinchou: ""The battleground smelled of blood.  deep craters remained where shells had flung earth into the sky.  Trees and rooftops were strewn all over.  The odors of blood and powder lingered.  Our fallen comrades had been laid out in front of grave makers made of available wood.  The area in front of these temporary graves was swept so clean it touched my heart.  I prayed there silently.""

Private First-Class Kubota Chuzo, a twenty-one-year-old farmer, wrote in his war diary: ""Today our company had lunch in the southern section of Chinchou.  Chinese corpses were piled everywhere.... Some enemy soldiers were found among the dead feigning death.  Our litter corps found them and slashed or stabbed them to death.""",,Sekiguchi Masajirō 関口政治郎[Marks: pub. ref. 462; seal not shown],Umezawa Chōkoku 梅澤彫刻 [full nameUmezawa Minokichi 梅澤己之吉],,,,October 1894 (Meiji 27),Impression excellent,Colors excellent,Condition good - trimmed but top margin intact; panel joined; vertical folds where panels are joined; some soiling and wrinkling,Genre ukiyo-e;senso-e (Sino-Japanese War),Format vertical ōban triptych,,H x W Paper 14 1/4 x 28 1/2 in.

It was an educated, but incorrect, guess brought about by a lack of a publication date on this print.  Recently, another copy of this print appeared with its left margin intact containing the name of the publisher and its date of issue, July 1894. (Click on image to the left for detail of left margin.)

It now becomes clear that this print depicts the landing of Japanese troops in Incheon on June 10, 1894, prior to the official outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War on July 25th.  The Japanese troops, likely parts of the Hiroshima 5th Division, were dispatched, ostensibly to protect the Japanese legation, but, in reality, as part of a troop buildup in Korea by both Japan and China.

By late July (July 23 or July 25,depending upon accounts) the First Sino-Japanese War had started.  Over fifty thousand military deaths and tensof thousands of civilian deaths later, the Japanese could declare victory inApril 1895. 

Released in July 1894, this unsigned/unsealed print waslikely one of the first of the thousands of senso-e(Japanese war prints) to “document” the Sino-Japanese War and to heroicallydepict the actions of the Japanese forces, to the Japanese public and Westernnations.

Two prints by Kunichika picturing the ""Kumagai Jin'ya"" scene, the last scene in the play Ichinotani Futaba Gunki, a dramatization of the Heiki Monogatari tale of the battle of Ichinotani. Both of these prints were issued by the same publisher.  The top print is dated January 1887, but the bottom print does not carry a date.  The same blocks were used for the actors, but with a color change to the robe on the character Midaroku in the left panel and a different wig (katsura) and slightly altered face and addition of kumadori makeup used for the character Kumagai in the center panel.  The actors, whose names appear in the cartouches, are different between the two prints with the exception of the actor Bandō Shūchō II who appears in the role of Fuji no Kata in the top print and the role of Sagami in the bottom print.

""Though the elements in Takahashi's prints seem to float in an untamed cosmos, or are simply reduced to a square or an oblong in perfect equilibrium, they fall unmistakably into place, arranged as precisely as the utensils for a formal tea ceremony.  The space is so ideally formulated that no furnishings are necessary; its architecture eliminates everything but that which is aesthetically and structurally indispensable.  The space itself is a product of light and shadow displayed in an 'unbalanced' tension.  The search for such 'unbalanced' forms has almost become an obsession, but it is nevertheless a positive aesthetic expression.  In such traditional Japanese arts as flower arranging or calligraphy, particularly in the informal styles associated with them, the consummate grace and elegance which can be achieved through the asymmetrical organization of forms in space is especially sought after.  Takahashi's forms possess a freedom in space, yet are nonobstructive in their simplicity and color.

The cartouche on the right is this collection's print which doesn't include the ""extra"" notation. 

To put this in context, prints of battle scenes were often issued before the actual battle took place. Upcoming battles could be gathered from news reports and other sources. Since the depiction of battle scenes was somewhat formulaic, the artist didn't need to be too concerned about depicting what actually would occur. It is likely that this collection's print without the ""extra"" notation was issued before the actual battle and that when the battle actually occurred on October 25th, the publisher added the ""extra"" notation to make it seem that the print was a true depiction of what occurred. Likely an effective advertising ploy. It should also be noted that the publisher seal which contains the publishing date is identical on both prints and it only indicates the year, with the month and day being left blank.

There are instances when prints announcing specific battles have been issued, only to have that battle not occur, as is the case of this collection's print Picture of the Hard fight at Fenghuangcheng, which depicts a battle that was planned by the Japanese as a present for the emperor on his birthday, but did not occur due to a retreat by the Chinese.

Number 191 of twenty-eight prints from the series Views of the Famous Sights of Japan (Nihon meishō zue) issued by the publisher Matsuki Heikichi in 1896 and 1897.  (For additional information on this series see the article Views of the Famous Sights of Japan.)  Two slightly different impressions of the same scene with a light blue replacing the grey sky.

Source: Kiyochika Artist of Meiji Japan, Henry D. Smith II, Santa Barbara Museum of Art, 1988, p. 108-109.
This print depicts one of the most remote places featured in the series and a location that Kiyochika may have been unable to visit in person.  It stands out as a particularly effective landscape in a series that overall is drab and uninspired.  Perhaps Kiyochika was most inspired by places that he recreated from second-hand images and information.

This location is a secluded mountain valley whose fame for scenic beauty was relatively recent, unlike the more established “famous places” like Futamigaura, Togonoura, and Nikko.  The discovery of newer sites of scenic beauty was the result of the enthusiasm among men of letters in the late Tokugawa (Edo) period (1603–1867) for traveling to remote places in search of beauty and history.  The plum trees at Tsukigase were made famous in Travels in Plum Valley (Baikei yuki) of 1830 by the Confucian scholar Saito Setsudo.

The vast plum orchard that Kiyochika shows in Inner Valley at Tsukigase is located along both banks of the Naban River, the name for the Kizu River in its upper reaches in the mountains of the Kii Peninsula.  Tsukigase (known locally as Tsukinose) is about ten miles due east of Nara along a stretch of the river running from east to west.  Some ten thousand plum trees line both sides of the V-shaped valley for over two  miles.  The trees were planted in the precincts of a nearby temple in the late thirteenth century, and later propagated in great numbers as the source of a dye extracted from the plum fruits.

The sight of the thousands of plum trees blooming in February and March is spectacular, and the white blossoms fill the valley with a heady fragrance, noted in the haiku concluding the text:

Spring in Tsukigase:
Bush warblers
Drunk with fragrance.

(Tsukigase no haru ya ka ni you momochidori.)

Kiyochika’s print is remarkable for the coloring-or rather the absence of it.  It is rendered almost completely in black sumi ink, which serves to heighten the sense of the whiteness of the blossoms; only the rushing waters of the Nabari River are shown in color, as streaks of subtle blue.",Number 19 in the series,Matsuki Heikichi [proprietor of Daikokuya Heikichi] with Daihei seal松木平吉大平[Marks: seal not shown; pub. ref. 029],,,,,February 1897 (Meiji 30),Impression IHL Cat. #340: excellent; IHL Cat. #1843: excellent,Colors IHL Cat. #340: excellent; IHL Cat. #1843: excellent,"Condition IHL Cat. #340: fair - paper soiling, one spot of foxing in cartouche, full margins, unbackedIHL Cat. #1843: good - paper soiling, particularly in margins; full margins; unbacked",Genre ukiyo-e;meisho-e,Format vertical ōban,H x W Image IHL Cat. #340: 13 5/16 x 8 9/16 in.

This print is from  a loosely constructed series Famous Views of Tokyo (Tokyo meisho) consisting of 93 prints issued from 1876-1881 by two publishers, Matsuki Heikichi and Fukuda Kumajirô.  For additional information on this series see ""Early Woodblock Prints: The Series Famous Views of Tokyo (Tokyo meisho) 1876-1881"" on the Kobayashi Kiyochika (1847-1915) page.",Miscellaneous print appears to be coated with a clear lacquer.

For Masaji's abstract take on Ryoan-ji see Ground No. 3. Ryoanji is the most famous and celebrated garden in Japan. Simply composed of stone and sand, it serves as a subtle yet effective example of the dry garden type.
This print is attributed to Yoshida Masaji (1917–1971) by Kanda's Gallery of Tokyo.  A sticker on the back of the framed print reads: 

ZEN GARDEN
One of the arts that flourished under the influence of Zen philosophy was garden architecture.  Although the Japanese garden was always a replica of nature in miniature, in the 14th century the size was further reduced and the trees and shrubs replaced by rocks and sand.

The stone garden of Ryoan-ji temple in Kyoto, laid out in the 15th century, is the most famous for the fifteen rocks, arranged in five groups, on raked sand.  The harmony in color, shape and size of the rocks makes this one of the most subtle and powerful gardens in Japan.  The rocks can be interpreted as islands in a river or as high peaks soaring over clouds.","Attributed to ""Masaji Yoshida"" by Kanda's Gallery, Tokyo per label on back of frame",likely self-published,,,,,unknown,Impression excellent,Colors excellent,Condition excellent - matted and framed (not examined out of frame),Genre sōsaku hanga,,H x W Image 3 3/4 X 5 3/4 in.

The buildings on the right are Futami Okitama Shrine, dedicated to the deities Sarutahiko Ōkami and Ukanomitama. Pilgrims often visit this shrine and purify themselves before proceeding to Ise Shrine.

One of three prints I purchased as a group attributed to the print and nihonga artist Ide Gakusui (1899-1978) who designed most of his prints for the publisher Watanabe Shōzaburō (1885-1962). While this print is neither signed nor sealed, the verso bears the notation ""Ide"".  Also written in pencil verso is the date ""30 May 57"", although the left margin on the front of the print carries the hand written date 昭和卅三年一月作 [a work of Showa 33rd year 1st month (January 1958)].  All three prints appear to be in the style of sōsaku hanga, rather than the shin hanga style of his prints designed for Watanabe.  None of the three prints carry a publisher's mark.

In the scroll-like cartouche, shown below, it mentions that she is charming 艶美 and beautiful 容色 (but, the cartouche remains untranslated for now.) 

There is little in the literature about the role of women in the Rebellion, but it is known that a women's brigade existed and a number of prints show women in battle on the side of the rebels.  In an 1880 Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (1839-1892) print titled Kirino Toshiaki's Mistress (collection of the National Gallery of Victoria2) a partial translation of its text reads, ""During the fight she stands at the head of the women's troops; when resting she offers help, shares out food and looks after the soldiers' needs, together in suffering and joy.”  The NGV refers to Akiko 秋子, by the name Hisa, but that seems to be an error on their part, as is referring to Akiko as Kirino's wife, rather than as his mistress 妾.

I have not been able to determine whether the blue/green bordered edition or state was issued before or after the brown/green bordered edition/state of prints in this series.  For this particular print, Aoto Fujitsuna, the brown/green border state has much crisper lines indicating an earlier printing than the blue/green state. In addition to the border coloration, the two states show other significant differences, the most prominent being the clothing worn by the servant with the torch and the treatment of the flame from Aoto's torch.

I have not been able to determine whether the blue/green bordered edition or state was issued before or after the brown/green bordered edition/state of prints in this series.  For this particular print, Aoto Fujitsuna, the brown/green border state has much crisper lines indicating an earlier printing than the blue/green state. In addition to the border coloration, the two states show other significant differences, the most prominent being the clothing worn by the servant with the torch and the treatment of the flame from Aoto's torch.

The two artists often collaborated and the publishing entity New Famous Places of Kyoto Publication Society, is likely a construct of the two artists.

In this print, a woman, pushing her young son in a stroller, passes by one of the many statues of reclining cows at Kyoto's Kitano Tenmangū Shrine, dedicated to the spirit of the exiled scholar and poet Sugawara no Michizane. The young boy is pointing to the cow, which visitors seeking good fortune in their scholarly pursuits often stroke as they pass by. (See below to find out why cows are associated with Michizane.) The temple is known for its famous plum trees that bloom from late February throughout March.

On September 13, 1894, Japanese naval officers met on shipboard to plan the strategy for the battle for control of the Yellow Sea.

Toshikata's skills as an illustrator are evident here.  The interaction of the figures through gaze, body position, and gesture informs the viewer that real discussion is taking place.  The close-up view of the protagonists gathered around the table, while the other Japanese ships wait in the background, dramatizes this portentous meeting.  The artist's successful representation of space and perspective is the result of his training in the Maruyama-Shijo style and not the new Meiji Western style painting (yoga).""

""In a triptych dated September 1894, Mizuno Toshikata (1866-1908) portrayed senior naval officers debating strategy on the eve of Japan's decisive victory for control of the Yellow Sea.  The encounter, which took place on September 17, is said to have been the first naval battle in history between steam-powered fleets.  The men are aboard one of Japan's twelve warships, all built in Britain.  One advantage the Japanese had was rapid-firing artillery as exemplified by the deck gun visible in the left panel of the print.  It is a scene of calm before the angry storm; the balanced, symmetrical composition and subdued coloring contribute to the dignified, serious mood of the occasion.

Although Saigō's head was severed from his body, this depiction of the presentation of the severed heads of the rebels is a fabrication of the artist and publisher and was repeated in other prints by various artists and publishers.  As explained by historian Mark Ravina in his work The Last Samurai, the Meiji government had done away with the medieval practice of displaying heads and the modern imperial army had no need to show their fealty to the central government in this manner.1

A first-hand account of Saigō's corpse by American ship captain John Capen Hubbard, who was employed by the Mitsubishi Steamship Company during the rebellion, is provided by Ravina:

He was a large powerful looking man, his skin almost white.  His clothing had been taken off and he lay there naked.  It was a few seconds before I realized his head was cut off.  Next to Saigo lay Kirino, then Murata.  Saigo's was the only headless body, but the others were a fearful sight to look at.  Their heads were dreadfully cut up and it was quite evident that they killed each other.  No doubt their heads would all have been cut off by their own people had time permitted.  While [we were] looking at the bodies, Saigo's head was brought in and placed by his body.  It was a remarkable looking head and any one would have said at once that he must have been the leader.2",price 6 sen,画工古林栄成 [artist Kobayashi Eisei]猿樂町二丁目三番地 [artist's address]出版人 山中北郞 [Yamanaka Kitarō山中北郞],n.a.,n.a.,,,"Date October 11, 1877 明治十年十月十一日 御届 [see publisher's seal below]",Impression excellent,Colors excellent,Condition fair - three sheets joined; parts of bottom margin missing; other margin damage; minor soiling,Genre ukiyo-e senso-e,Format vertical ōban triptych,n.a.,H x W Paper 14 3/8 x 29 in.

Barry Till, Curator of Asian Art at the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, in commenting on this print identifies the printmaker as an ""unidentified artist, probably Hashimoto Chikanobu (1838-1912) and goes on to say,  ""Chikanobu made several versions of the imperial couple at European-style horse races; one, incorrectly, had the horses racing clockwise.  This print is not signed by Chikanobu, but it is almost certainly his work.""  (See below images for some of Chikanobu's other prints of this scene.)

For this 1993 print, Hara has substituted a turbulent grey background for his usual blank ground and limited the number of strokes to five.  Speaking of this new twist in the artist's work Jackie Menzies in Contemporary Japanese Prints: The Urban Bonsai, 1992 comments, ""now in his recent work the strokes are fewer and contrasted against a soft, subtly expressive grey background. In such works he seems to introduce a more personal element, admitting that he wants to express the rhythm and timbre of his spirit through the strokes of his moving arm.""5",,self-published,,self-printed,,,1993,Impression excellent,Colors excellent,Condition excellent,Genre contemporary lithograph,n.a.,,H x W Paper 23 5/8 x 23 5/8 in.

The re-issued series of prints eliminated the brocade borders of the original series issued between 1885 and 1890.

The original blocks for this print (see this collection's 1885 original-issue print Kesa Gozen from the series Instructive Models of Lofty Ambition) were likely damaged or lost, as this 1902 print uses a new design to illustrate the story of Kesa Gozen.

It is unclear to me whether the print's scene is set before Michizane's exile or during his exile on Kyushu Island.

This print is the second of two prints in this series by Kiyochika portraying Michizane in the same pose.  The first print, shown left, was published in October 1885, approximately two and a half years before the April 1889 publication of the above print.  The earlier work has a much more complex background which includes a rearing horse.   The scroll-like cartouches on each print which provide the title of the print and information on the historical figure, contain the same text.  As with several prints in this popular series, the original blocks may have been lost or damaged, requiring the publisher to request a new design from the artist and have new blocks carved.

The play is based on the Kyōwa era (1801-1804) incident known as the Enmeiin Affair, in which Nichido ""an actor-turned-priest used a secret chamber at the Nichiren temple Enmeiin to seduce a number of leading ladies from the shogun’s house.""2 

Nichido was first an actor but became the superior of Enmeiin, a temple of the Nichiren sect in Yanaka, and, with the aid of the priestling Ryuzen, enticed women thither, making the place a den of immorality, visited even by ladies-in-waiting at the Court.  That priests should break their vows of chastity was so common that no one gave it a second thought, but when we have a man who turned priest from actor and alluring women to his temple for immoral purposes, it throws a glaring light on the moral degradation of the age.3

Nichido was later executed “as much on account of the links with the shogun’s household as of his moral shortcoming.""4",embossing throughout priest's robe in left panel,Kobayashi Tsunekichi 小林常吉 [Marks: seal not shown; pub. ref. 259]Center cartouche: 出板人 publisher left column - 小林常吉 Kobayashi Tsunekichi;  right column - publisher's address reading Hatchōbori  Mizutanichō 4-banchiRight cartouche: 画工 artist left column -t 安達平七 Adachi Heishichi [Adachi Ginkō's  birth name];  right column - artist's address Left cartouche: 定價六戔 price 6 sen,n.a.,,,,"October 8, 1878 (Meiji 11) 御届明治十一年十月八日",Impression excellent,Colors excellent,Condition good - not backed; margins mostly trimmed to image; minor soiling,Genre ukiyo-e; yakusha-e,Format vertical ōban triptych,,H x W Paper 13 3/4 x 9 1/4 in.

Twelve of the drawings are landscapes (sansui ga), one is a drawing of a bird on a plum branch (kachō ga) and one a scene from the Japanese folktale Kachi-kachi Yama (Crackling Mountain), in which a hare smashes the boat of his rival, a tanuki (a mythical raccoon dog/badger.)

In describing Beisen's work, Henry P. Bowie, lawyer, artist, author and student of Beisen's states ""Kubota was so skillful in sketching that while traveling rapidly through a country he could faithfully reproduce the salient features of an extended landscape, conformable to the general rule in sketching, that what first attracts the eye is to be painted first, all else becoming subordinate to it in the scheme.""1

Miyashita in pencil,not sealed,"While primarily known for his brightly colored prints which combine woodblock and metal plate print making techniques, Miyashita also created a number of monochrome etchings, such as this view of old warehouses and purse seiners on an unidentified river.  The print is untitled, but was auctioned under the title Tokyo Dockside.  While the middle ground warehouses and fishing boats look old, the city buildings seen in the background, including one skyscraper in the distance, are modern.  The work, like most of Miyashita's work is undated.

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation 

This print is special in many ways.  First of all, it was done my Miss Iwami Reika, the first woman in the history of Japanese prints, so far as I know, to attain full stature.  It is true that Hokusai's daughter, an extraordinary girl known by the name of Chin-chin because her protruding jaw reminded one of the Pekinese dog (called chin in Japanese), issued a few works that gained wide circulation in the middle years of the nineteenth century; but she was never really much more than a curiosity, and her work was in no way commendable.  It is also true that today there are other fine women print artists who are gaining increasing recognition - Shima Tamami and Yoshida Chizuko, to name only two - and that there are now enough of them to have an informal association and to hold periodic exhibits of considerable worth.  But Miss Iwami represents the vanguard, and for two women to win prizes in a competition such as the present one signalizes a triumph of no small proportion.  It has never been easy for women to attain prominence in Japanese art, and for two such young ones to have done so is indeed an accomplishment.

More important, artistically, however, is the second fact: this print exhibits a mastery of texture and color that is enviable.  The utilization of wood grain in the three standing pillars is very satisfying and gives the print a surcharge of emotion.  The printing of this passage and also of the background grays is first rate, skillful overprinting being used to bring out unanticipated textures.  In others of her prints, Miss Iwami uses a striking palette of burnt orange, crisp yellow, and flashing red.  Here she is more subdued, but her vivid sense of color values nevertheless expresses itself in the telling slash of red across the moon.

The third reason why this print has a special significance in this series is that it exemplifies rather handsomely the best effects that are being obtained by the nonrepresentational artists in simplifying subject matter to the ultimate.  What more need by said about winter in Japan, where the wonderful texture of the unpainted wooden houses stands so starkly against the cold sky?  The resulting patterns are most satisfying, emotionally, and many people who have had an opportunity to live closely with others of Miss Iwami's prints can testify to the subtle gratifications one discovers in having them around.  They are somehow right; both the eye and the mind find them recurrently pleasing, and thus they satisfy one of the great purposes of art: they remind us of how simple the most effective measures usually are.  Miss Iwami utilizes simple means, simple design, simple, bold coloring, and out of this produces a complex, sophisticated whole that has the capacity to please without cloying.

The final characteristic of this print that makes it special for me is that it was done by an artist whom I had the pleasure of helping discover.  All the men represented in this book were well-established performers before I came on the Tokyo scene.  Hiratsuka was producing fine prints before I was born, and Maekawa too.  Azechi was well into his third period - the portraits of mountaineers against stylized peaks - before I met him; and each of the other artists was well known.  But Iwami Reika was not.1",,"Charles E.

Forty-year-old Captain Matsuzaki Naoomi from Kumamoto on Kyushu led his men on July 29, 1894, in attacking the enemy on the other side of the river.  In this print the fearless captain battles cowering Chinese soldiers.  But he was ambushed from one hundred feet and was shot through the leg.  Undaunted, he continued to fight gallantly with his sword.  When he was struck by another bullet in the head, he is reported to have shouted, “I’ve been hit!” and to have died bravely.

It is a satire of an episode in the classic struggle between the Genji and Heike clans in medieval Japan in which Yoshitsune, the Genji clan general and superior of the warrior Kumagai, foretells that Kumigai will be faced with killing Atsumori, a young warrior of the Heike clan whose mother has previously saved Kumagai's life. Yoshitsune devises a tragic solution for Kumigai, placing a notice board near Kumigai's camp, by a cherry tree, which reads: 

Here stands a rare double-flowering cherry tree from the south. If anyone cuts off a branch, his punishment, following the ancient case of the Maple Tree, shall be to cut off one finger for each branch cut. Second Month, 1184.1

As written in Japanese, it is layered with multiple meanings. In the context of the legend, the hidden meaning is ""Anyone killing a son must kill his own son"" meaning Kumagai must kill his own son rather than Atsumori. This story is the basis of several famous Kabuki plays including Kumagaijinya.

Kiyochika's print shows a warrior (Kumigai?) with a surprised expression, holding onto a branch he has just broken off a cherry tree while reading the notice board message. Unfortunately, I've been unable to read or translate the message, but the message does seem to have a police notice on it prohibiting the braking of branches from the tree.

Kiyochika pictures a lone boat being plied off the rocky coast of Cape Kannon on the eastern edge of the Miura Peninsula along the southwest portion of Tokyo Bay.  In 1812 the Tokugawa Shogunate set up a lookout here to protect Edo from Western ships. In 1868 a lighthouse was built on the cape under the direction of of the Frenchmen F. L. Verny following the requests of foreign powers under the provisions of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce of 1858. It was the first modern lighthouse to be built in Japan, being first lit on February 11, 1869, immediately after the Meiji restoration, and during the last months of the Boshin War.  It was destroyed by an earthquake in 1922. A second lighthouse was soon destroyed by the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923.

Miyashita works in his usual combination of woodblock and intaglio.""2

The Process of Combining Woodblock and Etching (intaglio) Techniques
Source: Japanese Prints Today: Tradition with Innovation, Margaret K. Johnson, Dale K. Hilton, Shufunotomo Co., Ltd., 1980, p. 213-219.

And a challenging marriage it is, of traditional Japanese and traditional European processes.  Miyashita uses the Ukiyo-e woodblock technique requiring water-based inks and absorbent paper.  On the same print he uses intaglio techniques demanding oil-based inks and a paper that responds sensitively to these inks, and, at the same time is strong and resilient enough to take the pressure of the etching press. Kikuzki Kozo is the paper that has the necessary characteristics.  It has tough fibers and accepts both water-based inks and oil-based inks.  To offer the appealing characteristics of both processes, Miyashita prints color areas from woodblocks and overlays these with details and contours printed from an intaglio plate inked in black.

He first composes and assembles the intaglio plate cut from a zinc sheet to appropriate print size.  On the plate he assembles assorted sizes and shapes of zinc or copper plate with details added by etched or scratched lines.  Sometimes he adds found object, such as stamped metal fragments or even old photo-engrave plates... Miayashita moves these pieces around on the plate until he achieves an effective juxtaposition.... [W]hen he is satisfied with his composition, he solders the pieces to the plate. [See below photos.]

The next step is to decide what the colors of the shapes and background areas will be and to plan how many blocks are needed for the color separations.  Where color areas are far enough apart to avoid mingling of the different colored inks, he can use one block to print several colors.  Otherwise he must use a separate block for each color.  The blocks must be the same size as the zinc plate.  The image is then transferred from the plate to these woodblocks.  To do this, he inks the plate image, wipes off the excess ink, and places the plate on the bed of the etching press.  He lays a paper over this and runs both through the press, thereby transferring the inked image onto the paper.  Next he places the paper, ink-side down on the woodblock, and rubs the top side wit a baren to transfer the ink from the paper to the block.  This transfer process is repeated for each block he will need.  This method of double-transfer - from plate to paper to block - assures a positive image on the woodblocks in proper registration with the metal plate.  If the image were transferred directly from plate to block, the image would be in reverse as seen through a mirror.

The blocks are now ready to be carved.  Miyashita cuts away the parts of the block not to be printed; the small shapes to be printed are left as islands on the plywood sheets, while the background areas are left intact except for the smaller shapes which he carves away - the same shapes taht are islands on other blocks.

When the blocks are cut, he is ready to ink and print them in the standard Japanese method.  Miyashit uses poster-color directly from the jar, diluting them as needed with water.  He does nto mix colors before applying them to the block.  He does, however, merge one color into another on the block to create bokashi effects...  To do this consistently from print to print in an edition, he marks this clothesbrush-shaped brush according to where to load the colors.  With the colored inks in the brush he sweeps it across the block precisely along the same course for each print.  To build the pigment on the paper sufficiently in both the bokashi and flat-color areas, Miyashita may need to brush each color onto the block many times to make repeated printings.  By this means, he achieves the velvety rich color characteristic of his work.  All of the color areas must be printed on each paper of an edition before the intaglio image can be printed over them.  He then hangs the paper to dry.  Before printing the zinc plate he must wet the prints again using a wide brush to lightly spread the water.

Miyashita then inks the zinc plate.  He rubs the black oil-base dink over the entire surface, working it into all the crevices.  Then...he carefully wipes the ink away form the smooth surfaces.  If he leaves a thin veil of ink on these surfaces by choosing not to wipe them clean, a subtle patina is added to the whole print, deepening the richness of the underlying block-printed colors.  It is the different thicknesses of black ink - from the heavy black around the rough solder contours, to the delicate tones of the etched, and drypointed details - that add the jewel-like quality to the imagery.  While the solder-contours may look crude on the plate, these same projecting lines, when inked and printed, make a natural looking soft outline for the shapes of color they encompass.

By combining two techniques of vastly different origin and character, Miyashita has melded his own form of expression: bold, bright, rough-hewn, yet refined and singularly elegant in effect.  The viewer's imagination may bring its own meaning to the work or the visual feast itself may be enough.",n.a.,artist,n.a.,n.a.,,,"undated, but likely 1976",Impression excellent,Colors excellent,Condition excellent - minor printer smudge in lower right margin; two pin holes edge of image in center,Genre sōsaku hanga,n.a.,H x W Image 11 x 13 5/8 in.

The texture of the woodblock itself creates dappled tones and fragile shades.   The works are light, yet the source of the light is hidden behind fences and arches.  It is a light defined by shadows, creating a mood of timeless suspension.

Leafless branches cast foreground shadows, mysteriously real and abstract, stark and delicate.  The texture of the block, structural unity of the geometric ground figures, subdued coloration and shading, and magical, waving forms together create a locus, a place that is both definite and infinite, haunting and unassuming, vague and too vivid to be mere fantasy.

This scene references Ōishi's ruse of living the high life with the geisha of Kyoto, while he was plotting his revenge on Lord Kira, who was responsible for his master Lord Asano's death.  Ōishi's actions in avenging his master and his subsequent suicide, as ordered by the shogunate, was seen as ideal samurai behavior.

This is one of only a handful of prints depicting the historical character Ōishi Kuranosuke rather than an actor using a thinly veiled character name, e.g. Ōboshi Yuranosuke, playing Ōishi in a kabuki version of the historical incident.

the Miraiki みらいき, a chronicle foretelling the future and attributed to Prince Shōtoku.  The Miraiki proved influential in 14th and 15th-century politics, as many of its prognostications proved true.2  A Buddhist monk sits beside Kusunoki and the large pine tree in the background may allude to the deposed emperor Godaigo's famous dream that foretells of his reigning again as the true emperor.  After the dream Godaigo combines the character for ""south"" with that for ""tree,"" producing kusunoki, or camphor tree.  Kusunoki a warrior ""famous as a wielder of bow and arrow,"" is then summoned from nearby Kawachi province.  Kusunoki pledges to dedicate his life to restoring Godaigo's ""imperial destiny.""

While only the actor's roles are provided on the print (within the orange cartouches) the website of the Waseda University Library1 provides the actor's names and the title of the play. 

The Play ""Akegarasu Hana no Nureginu""

Leiter translates the play's title as ""TheCawing Crow at Daybreak and a Flower Suspected""1.  I believe that the play, in its first performance, it was inserted after the eighth act of Kanadehon Chūshingura.
Source: Kabuki Encyclopedia, An English-Language Adaption of Kabuki Jiten, Samuel L. Leiter, Greenwood Press, 1979, p. 12-13.
AKEGARASU (HANA NO NUREGINU). Sakurada Jisuke III. Sewamono. Kabuki. One act. February 1851. Ichimura-za. Edo. 

This work was inspired by a popular Osaka piece in the musical style called shinnai bushi – Akegarasu Yume no Awayuki – which described the lovers’ suicides of Inosuke, a son of a purveyor to the government, and Miyoshino, a prostitute. Jisuke’s version, written in Edo, is performed with kiyomoto2 music. It was a great hit at its first performance, largely because of the beautiful voice of the kiyomoto singer, Kyomoto Tahei, and the acting of Ichikawa Danjūrō VIII as Tokijirō and Bandō Shūka I as Urazato. 

In its first production, this play was part of a long work by Jisuke, based on the classic Kanadehon Chūshingura, but subsequent revivals omitted the connection with that play. 

Urazato, a courtesan of the Yamana-ya, and her lover, Tokijirō, are the parents of Midori, a child maidservant at the brothel. Since a courtesan’s having a permanent lover is considered an obstacle to the business operations of the Yamana-ya, an attempt is made to separate the pair. One snowy day an employee of the brothel discovers Urazato engaged in a secret rendezvous with Tokijirō. The latter is driven away, and the courtesan is tied to a pine tree in the garden and beaten. Urazato bemoans her ills for a time and weeps. However, Tokijirō steals over the fence and rescues her; the lovers escape with Midori on her father’s back. 

Urazato’s lamentation scene (kudoki) and her love scene with Tokijirō are accompanied by melancholy kiyomoto music. At the heart of the piece is the gruesome beauty of the beating in the snow and its resultant pathos",,山甚板 Yamajin han seal of the publisher Yamashiroya Jinbei 山城屋甚兵衛 [Marks pub. ref. 601; seal 25-232],彫工巳之 Horikō Mino,,,,"1851 (Kaei 4), 4th month","Impression excellent

Both prints are views within Nihonbashi, the most densely populated area of Tokyo.  The top print above (IHL Cat. #1280) provides a past, or old (古), view of the Yoroi Ferry, which carried passengers across the Nihonbashi canal to at Kabuto-chō to Koami-chō, Tokyo’s mercantile quarter of Nihonbashi, an area filled with warehouses stocked with rice, soy, and oil. It is matched with a present, or now (今), view on the bottom sheet (IHL Cat. #1290), depicting the Yoroi Bridge, built in 1873, that replaced the Yoroi Ferry.  In the present view, a gentlemen in modern Western-style dress can be seen. Interestingly, and confusing to me, is how the Yoroi Bridge, built as a Western-style iron bridge is depicted, showing no modern elements of steel construction.

These past and present views were orginally printed together as one oban-size sheet as shown below and later cut apart.  They are two of at least 32 views, contained on 16 uncut oban-size sheets, in the series Famous Places of Tokyo: Past and Present.

Both prints are views within Nihonbashi, the most densely populated area of Tokyo.  The top print above (IHL Cat. #1280) provides a past, or old (古), view of the Yoroi Ferry, which carried passengers across the Nihonbashi canal to at Kabuto-chō to Koami-chō, Tokyo’s mercantile quarter of Nihonbashi, an area filled with warehouses stocked with rice, soy, and oil. It is matched with a present, or now (今), view on the bottom sheet (IHL Cat. #1290), depicting the Yoroi Bridge, built in 1873, that replaced the Yoroi Ferry.  In the present view, a gentlemen in modern Western-style dress can be seen. Interestingly, and confusing to me, is how the Yoroi Bridge, built as a Western-style iron bridge is depicted, showing no modern elements of steel construction.

These past and present views were orginally printed together as one oban-size sheet as shown below and later cut apart.  They are two of at least 32 views, contained on 16 uncut oban-size sheets, in the series Famous Places of Tokyo: Past and Present.

The Series: Famous Places of Tokyo: Past and Present
A series of at least sixteen uncut oban-size sheets depicting a past or old (古) view on the top sheet, and present or now (今) view, on the bottom sheet, of a particular area of Tokyo. Many of the views are similar to those found in Hiroshige's One Hundred Famous Views of Edo (Meisho Edo hyakkei).

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
That one soft-spoken man dressed in a Russian-type smock should have been able to capture in one print the essence of things Japanese must remain a miracle. Yet here in this apparently simple work Hiratsuka Un'ichi has imprisoned much of the timeless beauty that characterizes Japan.

Artistically, the print is also an appropriate one with which to start a study of what is occurring in modern Japanese prints, for it is exclusively Japanese. Not a single alien component intrudes. The paper is a famous old make especially suited for prints. The ink is the same that has been for the last two-thousand years, made in the same way. The sever restriction to black and white follows the convention of the first great prints of Moronobu and his vigorous school of progenitors. Even the cutting of the wood is done with the same kinds of tools that the earliest artists used and with the same result in jagged line setting forth powerful solid areas. Technically, one can imagine this print to have been made three hundred years ago, and it is a joy to realize that what was so satisfying then remains so today.

But beyond the chance components of the print, and its technical austerity, one sees depicted here one of the secrets of Japanese art: repose and serenity achieved by the use of tension and complete control. No more appropriate print than this could have been found with which to launch this book.

Hiratsuka himself offers the below commentary:

The first idea that came to my mind in creating a print for this contest was to show a lakeside view of the Byodo-in. The impression I received when I first stood on the spot from which this print was conceived was so strong that it completely captured my heart. Hence I wanted to capture and present in the most powerful fashion that quiet moment in the afternoon when only the faint chirping of birds and the gentle rustle of falling autumn leaves could be heard. I have always believed that the motif of a print does not come through without inspiration, and that love and affection must accompany the carving and the printing. This work was created in that spirit.

The following technical information is also provided:

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
Here Maekawa shows us a country girl holding a lamp at such an angle as to illuminate her very Japanese face. In subject matter the print is thus a pleasant combination of old and new. The face, the lam, and the texture of the cloth are from the permanent past; the pattern of the cloth and the saucy pony-tail hairdo are definitely modern. Thus from the first glance one sees that this print represents a visual compromise.

Of special interest is the fact that the lamp throws upon the face a light which creates a masklike reflection, as if the artist had sought to convey by this subtle means the essential masklike character of the Japanese face with its large plastic forms, flat areas, and contrasting eyes. In no other country that I know have masks been so widely used as in Japan; religion and theater alike have made use of superb masks, and a collection of the historic wooden faces of the past centuries can be impressive.

In fact, the most appealing aspect of this print is its honest use of print techniques, and no work that appears in this book is more wholly within the print tradition than this. It is composed, first of all, of flat areas of color applies in large masses. The girl's hair, her face, her costume, and the right-hand shadow running down the chimney are all large masses used as they should be in print-making. The construction of the right hand is especially interesting, since it demonstrates how solid masses of color can be utilized to create the impression of form.

As for this print, it falls securely within the tradition that Maekawa long ago established for himself. The subdued color scheme is his. The touch of pink has been called almost a Maekawa trademark. And the winsome little girl is a sister to the hundreds of others he depicted. He was an artist with a feminine approach to life, indifferent to the tides of modernism that have swept his colleagues, and content to look lovingly at the village aspects of a land and a society that he obviously loved.1

Maekawa himself offers the below commentary:
Autumn is my favorite season, particularly early autumn when the first cool days come around. In this print I fetched from my childhood memories of autumn days one of the lamps that we used to use and then perched an autumn insect on it.2

The following technical information is also provided:

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
Through the long history of dance in Japan, its most brilliant moments have often been captured in prints, for theatrical subject matter has always been a major preoccupation with print artists. It has been estimated that about thirty-five percent of classical prints dealt with theatrical themes; of these, many of the finest depicted dances....

It is therefore appropriate that one of the strongest prints included in this volume should be a present-day depiction of one of the oldest types of Japanese dance.  More here shows us two oafish comedians engaged in the kind of Shinto dance that occurs at shrines like that of Kasuga as interludes between the more grave and sedate religious evocations.  These comic interruptions have always been extremely popular with the common people, who must have found the hour-long religious dances somewhat tedious, for in time these ridiculous interludes gained a permanent home even in the Noh theater, form where they moved happily into the more robust Kabuki, where they now form one segment of almost every bill.

Who these two yokels are I do not know.  Obviously they are the Oriental equivalent of Punch and Judy, of Bones and Sambo, of straight man and stooge.  One feels instinctively that they are engaged in some outrageous business, for they are the timeless comedians of all who work, the necessary interruption in any well-organized theater.  They are instantly recognized for what they are, and one of most pleasant recollections in working with these prints came when a New York theatrical producer hurried through my living room, took one look at the prints here assembled, stopped before this untitled Mori and exclaimed: ""Ah, the comedians!  How I wish I could find a face like that one!""

As a print-here, as in the terms of the contest, I follow the Japanese usage of so classifying stencils-this is a distinguished new work in an old technique.  As a conscious art form the stencil had all but died out in Japan, remaining only in such folk-art forms as the lovely bijigata stenciled prints of Okinawa, until revived in the present century by such men as Yamagi Soetsu, the father of Japan's now-flourishing folk-art movement, and the distinguished stencil artist Serizawa Keisuke, to both of whom Mori acknowledges a debt of gratitude for guidance.

Here the stencil's bold line and heavy mass is made a decided asset.  The colors have a somber theatricality about them, and the juxtaposition of the two idiotic figures is cramped and crowded like the proscenium of an Elizabethan stage.  There is a fine sense of flatness about the print, and at the same time a sensation of weight.  An oil painting of these two comic actors or even a woodblock print, each with its own characteristic texture, would make them look entirely different.  This is a stenciled print, and the relation between colors, paper, and pigment is beautifully handled.  The harsh simplicity of technique is wholly appropriate.  The lack of shading and the reliance upon mass is appealing, and the total impression is one of quick message, vigorously delivered.

In many respects this is a peculiarly Japanese work, for the although the figures might have stepped from some rowdy passage of the Italian commedia dell' arte, the manner in which they are depicted is purely Japanese.  The right-hand face, for example, comes straight from the puppet theater, and would be so recognized by any Japanese viewer, while the skirt and fan of the actor to the left recall both Noh and Kabuki.  Then, too, the use of these particular colors is indigenous to Japan, as is the placement of the seal.  This print could be as old as the dance itself.  It could date from somewhere back in the eleventh century, for it is a timeless product of Japan.  As such, it will be the last purely Japanese subject that we shall see in this book, and one leaves it with regret.

Mori's commentary:
This work was inspired by the comic Kagura dances given at Shinto shrine festivals throughout Japan. The dancers come onto the stage, generally a roofed outdoor platform in the shrine precincts, and to the accompaniment of the traditional drum and flute give hilarious pantomimes, which are also known as fools' dances. The idea for this print came from my fond childhood memories of such fools' dances.

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
In 1957 the hitherto unknown woodblock artist Kinoshita Tomio, then thirty-four years old, startled artistic Tokyo with a series of large prints consisting of stylized human heads depicted in a striking new manner. Usually only black and one color were used, and those subdued, but both critics and buying public found the results immensely to their liking, and a new artist was launched.

The chief characteristics of Kinoshita are well exemplified in this work, which is composed of severe geometrical patterns sensitively tied together into a pleasing design. The blocklike heads dominate the body of the print, but subsidiary geometrical patterns are utilized, as in the isosceles triangle that forms the chin of the left-hand face and the right-angled triangle that forms the hair of the right-hand head. The viewer is invited to find the other geometrical patterns for himself, and to see how cleverly they are juxtaposed in order to obtain maximum artistic effectiveness.

From the moment of Kinoshita's initial appearance I have been partial to his prints, for they convey a sense of great simplicity and force, a combination which often produces enviable art. They have a universal quality, for as I have pointed out they could be of Renaissance derivation, yet they also represent the stoic modern man set grimly against an age he does not fully comprehend or approve. Weak though they may be when confronted with forces of darkness, these men display stubbornness and courage, characteristics which are perhaps more easily detected in square-block figures then in the elliptical ones.1 [My note: reference the artist's biography and the print Big Boys,1958 for an example of Kinoshita's elliptical heads.]

Kinoshita's commentary:
A full title for this print would be ""Faces of the Weak Courageously Attempting to Move Forward in a World of Darkness."" This is one in a series of prints I have been working on for four or five years, all having the common motif of faces or masks. In combinations of faces such as the present I am trying to express the sufferings of society, of man, of mankind, of all living beings. I am not too certain of my results: perhaps in the end I have produced mere ""prints"".2

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
From the moment the prints in this contest were assembled,both critics and general public nominated one as pre-eminent. This lyric,exciting work by Shima Tamami has an immediate appeal which does not diminishwith familiarity. In color it is quiet and satisfying, each of its individualtones blending with the whole and each impressing the viewer as beingappropriate to the subject. The use of wood in graphic art is nowhere in thisseries better exemplified than here, while the carved line is both artisticallypleasing and technically expert.

But what gives the print its inviting charm is the subjectmatter, a handsome, stylized scene from nature in which the three birds aresplendidly varied in their attitudes, yet artfully disposed to produce awell-designed print. The brief suggestion of a woodland that runs through themiddle background of the print is cleverly done, while the contrast between skyand water is beautifully achieved.

This is a most adroit print, and I doubt if a better couldhave been found to illustrate in one brief example why it is that the modernJapanese print has been found so appealing by so many connoisseurs. Thesimplification attained in this work is admirable, but the depth of joy thatshows through that simplification is one of the finest things that art canaccomplish. I cannot imagine anyone's tiring of this rhythmic, plastic work,and if the reader should want a fine example of what the print form canachieve, this print would be the answer, for it is an almost perfect work.

There are many aspects of this print that will repay closestudy, but I should like to deal with only three: design, texture, and use ofwood.

Start with the outermost extremities of the bills of thethree birds, and see how, beginning with the one farthest away, the tips standeach at a similar distance from the top and the right-hand side of the paper'sedge, a distance which is repeated with the bottom and tail of the foremostbird. These points, taken in sequence from upper left, across the top of theprint and down the foremost bird's extended neck and around to his tail, formthe outside rhythmic pattern inside which the body of the print is confined.The three-quarter circle thus subtended is broken twice, once by the arbitraryintrusion of the band of woodland scene that cuts the right margin just belowthe middle, and again by the tail of the middle bird. When I first saw thisprint I liked the use of the bird's tail to break the rhythm very much, but Ithought the use of the light band somewhat arbitrary; now that I know the printmore intimately, I see that Shima was correct and that without that boldcutting of the pattern, the circle would look rather obvious.

To continue the discussion of the design, the placement ofthe three birds within the circle seems inspired. What differentiation theartist achieves, what variation in weight and balance, what a superbutilization of line to create form and implied movement! The three postures ofthe bills are a little obvious, I am afraid, but the extremely bold invention ofthe forefront bird in contorted sweep is something that most of us would havebeen quite incapable of. If the three bills are to be questioned as obvious,certainly that wild bird in front must be warmly commended as excellentartistic invention.

The manner in which the dark lower portion of the rear bird,as it intersects the band of forest, assumes the focal point of interest islikewise admirable; a lesser artist would have had his center of interest muchhigher and would thus have lost the relationship between the rear bird and thedominant forefront one. And the manner in which the middle bird ties the wholeinterior design together is commendable. The rhythm obtained by these variousdevices is positively insidious, for the beholder's eye keeps sweeping roundand round this picture, like a bird in flight.

One of the most attractive elements in this print is thevaried texture, divided into five contrasting types. There is the soft fleecyeffect of the sky, achieved by utilizing one distinct kind of wood creatively.There is the rippling texture of the water, achieved by using a different woodquite differently. There is the neutral texture of the band of forest whichheightens the contrast between sky and water. There is the glossy texture ofthe solid black portions of the birds. And there is the very effective mottledtexture on the backs of the first and second birds, obtained from a paper blockprinted in black over blue.

One would be most naive to assume that these contrasts wereaccidentally obtained. That they were so adroitly managed is a tribute to theartist, but also a reminder of how important texture has become in many modernJapanese prints. In this print the textures are tactile. One can feel with hisforefinger the different effects Shima is after. In Kinoshita's""Faces"" the texture is implied. In the print before that, Watanabe'smysterious figure of a man, the texture derives from the rough paper and theeven rougher application of colors. Three other artists not represented in thisbook who specialize in superb texturing of their prints are Mizufune, Nakayama,and Ono. Sometimes even to see the contrasts they obtain is pleasing,regardless of the subject matter of the print.

But few prints, even those by artists who have stressed thisaspect of art, have equaled Shima's use of texture as evidenced in this print,and much of the attractive quality which marks this work stems from its realand implied textures. Graphic art which ignores this problem today foregoes oneof its richest components.

The most distinctive aspect of this print, however, is itsuse of wood. On pieces of plywood, which is now customarily used by Japaneseartists since the original cherrywood block has proven too small and too hardfor the effects the modern artists desire, Shima found, for the upper half ofher background, a widely spaced, freely moving grain that resembled clouds and,for the lower, a rippling and more tightly spaced grain to suggest water. Withspecial pigments that emphasize the grain of the wood, she has obtainedprinting surfaces capable of recreating two quite distinct effects. The band ofdifferent texture thrown across the meeting line of the two woods wasbrilliantly conceived and eliminates what might otherwise have been a rathertransparent device: the harsh juxtaposition of the sky and water.

Shima's use of the broad-sweeping grain in the upper half ofher print was by no means a modern invention. It was used with marvelous effectas early as 1750 by the classical artist Ishikawa Toyonobu, who did severalprints with such backgrounds, and in 1765 by Suzuki Harunobu, who designed oneof his masterpieces, a dancer with a monkey, with a similar marbled background.In later works, especially those by Katsukawa Shun'ei and Utagawa Toyokuni,some designs, while not actually emphasizing the exposed grain of the wood, didstrive after somewhat similar effects by pressing the printing baren so harshly upon the wetted paperas to leave printing marks on the larger background areas. Such marks were heldto be artistically desirable, in that they reminded the viewer that the printhad sprung from a block of wood.

And here we are right back where we were in our reflectionsupon the preceding print, where Kinoshita Tomio carved an ordinary piece ofwood so as to impart the sense of oak to his print. Here Shima Tamami has donejust the opposite; she has searched for sheets of plywood which were sofortuitously constructed that they could hardly help but impart to their printa real sense of woodiness. Without in any way denying the beauty and power ofShima's results, of the two artistic techniques I still prefer Kinoshita's. Ihave already, in my remarks on his ""Faces,"" given my rationale forthis judgment. So in all fairness to Shima I should also admit to a subjectiveand quite irrelevant prejudice.

Japan has always had a group of craftsmen who search fortsuga (spruce-hemlock) wood of interesting texture. They char it in a fire,then rub away the burned pith, leaving myriad little black ridges against ahandsome dark-brown underpith. From such wood these men carve the cleveresthoptoads, in which the alternate strata of black ridge and uncharred pith aremade to look like a frog's skin with warts. Tourists seem to love these frogs,but I find the damned things repulsive, a reductio ad absurdum of the Japaneselove of wood which is here so appealingly expressed by Shima.1


Shima's commentary:
I have worked with the bird motif ever since 1 first took up prints. In the composition of the present print I treated the birds as still-life objects. I am not completely satisfied with this print because of its small size.2

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation 

This print is special in many ways.  First of all, it was done my Miss Iwami Reika, the first woman in the history of Japanese prints, so far as I know, to attain full stature.  It is true that Hokusai's daughter, an extraordinary girl known by the name of Chin-chin because her protruding jaw reminded one of the Pekinese dog (called chin in Japanese), issued a few works that gained wide circulation in the middle years of the nineteenth century; but she was never really much more than a curiosity, and her work was in no way commendable.  It is also true that today there are other fine women print artists who are gaining increasing recognition - Shima Tamami and Yoshida Chizuko, to name only two - and that there are now enough of them to have an informal association and to hold periodic exhibits of considerable worth.  But Miss Iwami represents the vanguard, and for two women to win prizes in a competition such as the present one signalizes a triumph of no small proportion.  It has never been easy for women to attain prominence in Japanese art, and for two such young ones to have done so is indeed an accomplishment.

More important, artistically, however, is the second fact: this print exhibits a mastery of texture and color that is enviable.  The utilization of wood grain in the three standing pillars is very satisfying and gives the print a surcharge of emotion.  The printing of this passage and also of the background grays is first rate, skillful overprinting being used to bring out unanticipated textures.  In others of her prints, Miss Iwami uses a striking palette of burnt orange, crisp yellow, and flashing red.  Here she is more subdued, but her vivid sense of color values nevertheless expresses itself in the telling slash of red across the moon.

The third reason why this print has a special significance in this series is that it exemplifies rather handsomely the best effects that are being obtained by the nonrepresentational artists in simplifying subject matter to the ultimate.  What more need by said about winter in Japan, where the wonderful texture of the unpainted wooden houses stands so starkly against the cold sky?  The resulting patterns are most satisfying, emotionally, and many people who have had an opportunity to live closely with others of Miss Iwami's prints can testify to the subtle gratifications one discovers in having them around.  They are somehow right; both the eye and the mind find them recurrently pleasing, and thus they satisfy one of the great purposes of art: they remind us of how simple the most effective measures usually are.  Miss Iwami utilizes simple means, simple design, simple, bold coloring, and out of this produces a complex, sophisticated whole that has the capacity to please without cloying.

The final characteristic of this print that makes it special for me is that it was done by an artist whom I had the pleasure of helping discover.  All the men represented in this book were well-established performers before I came on the Tokyo scene.  Hiratsuka was producing fine prints before I was born, and Maekawa too.  Azechi was well into his third period - the portraits of mountaineers against stylized peaks - before I met him; and each of the other artists was well known.  But Iwami Reika was not.1",,"Charles E.

For one thing, it demonstrates rather clearly the manner in which the younger artists are adapting the oldest techniques to their particular needs. [Maki]. . . gains much force by utilizing three different qualities of black: the traditional solid black in the upright stroke; a medium-force black in the lower horizontal stroke; and a handsomely mottled semi-gray black in the upper curved stroke. This wide contrast yields a most pleasing effect, and the eye is constantly lured from one of the variations to the other.
A second deviation from old patterns is Maki's skillful use of three different textures of wood: the traditional solid, unblemished printing of the upright; the striking vertical graining of the lower horizontal; and the pleasing delicate mottling of the upper curve. Again, these textures carry the eye from one part of the design to the next, and when the variation in texture is wedded to the basic variation in the value of the black, a constant movement of symbol is attained, a kind of stately minuet of black and texture as forst one shape and the next takes command of the eye. Study the print for some minutes and watch this persuasive dance begin.

The third innovation is, of course, the most important. This concerns Maki's skilled use of the calligraphic symbol as the subject matter of art. In the contest several artists submitted prints constructed from calligraphic designs: some were marvelous free-flowing constructions in which the ideographs which Japan originally borrowed from China stood out conspicuously; others were bold utilizations of ideographic elements but without quite forming specific ideographs that could be identified; still others were abstractions which contained the merest suggestion of a calligraphic base.

The decision was finally made in favor of the present Maki. . . because its symbol was clearly derived from calligraphy yet so subtly modified as to free it from an obvious bondage. Furthermore, the symbol was used in such a controlled manner, both in coloring-texture and in disposition, as to remind the viewer that this was a work of conscious art.1


Maki himself offers the below commentary:
This print is based upon the character 牛, meaning cow or ox. I have here tried to give our cultural heritage of such ideographs a modern feel, but in an Oriental style. This meant trying to capture the typically Japanese expression of the beauty of space, the sense of reverence for and persistent pursuit of boundless space, while at the same time taking advantage of the boundary provided by the beauty and life of the paper itself. The beauty of sumi, in it monochrome black, penetrates to the back of the paper and forbids decorative exaggeration or irrelevancies. This effect combines with a succinct and straightforward approach to create a space and an expression that, though intentionally compact, still have a quiet and gentle spread. The two small red seals are an integral part of the composition, providing color and a focal point and thus making the impersonality of the sumi's space deeper and wider and warmer.2

The following technical information is also provided: 
THE PRINT: Artist's title: ""Ushi"" (Ox). Four blocks (cherry, lauan, and sen) of both solid board and plywood. One block printed in gaufrage to define the outer limits of the print with its embossed line, and the others printed in sumi ink and black Japanese-style pigment, on natural-color kozo paper. One impression for the gaufrage block and two impressions each for the black blocks.3",,"Charles E.

Given the red banner displaying the characters 成田山 (Narita-san) held by one of the spectators, as seen on the far right of the right sheet, it is likely that this play is being staged at or near Narita-san temple (the head temple of the Chisan sect of Shingon Buddhism) in Fukagawa, where the deity, the Wrathful Bright King Fudō Myōō, is worshipped. The timing of this performance was likely coincident with one of the periodic public displays (unveilings) of sacred objects (kaichō) held by Narita-san and other temples to raise funds.

The right sheet of this print shows Sawamura Tosshō II in the role of the monk/spiritual leader Kōbō Daishi, founder of Shingon Buddhism, who is said to have carved an image of Fudō Myōō while in China in the early 800s which he used to pacify the waves in a great storm.

The center sheet shows Kawarazaki Gonjūrō, who will take the name of Ichikawa Danjūrō IX in 1884, as the deity Fudō Myōō surrounded by flames representing the burning of anger and passion to purify the mind.

The left sheet shows Daikoku, the god of good fortune, whose presence may relate to the fund raising aspect of the kaichō.

The three figures are matched with three low-city districts in early Tokyo, renowned for working-class entertainment and commerce: god of good fortune Daikoku is matched with Asakusa; the Fudō Myōō of the Narita-san temple complex is matched with Fukagawa; and the monk/spiritual leader Kōbō Daishi is matched with Ryōgoku.",n.a.,seal reading Hamatetsu han濱鉄 板.

Ōe no Takachika, 大江の挙周 (c. 977-1046) the son of the 11th century poetess Akazome Emon fell seriously ill after he became Governor of Izumi. Akazome Emon, much aggrieved, dedicated a sacred staff with a poem offering her life for her son’s to Sumiyoshi Shrine. The poem read:
    
 The life I pray
 
 Be taken in place of his
 
 I do not begrudge;

 But on the parting

 Is so bitter!         Kawaran to

 Inoru inochi wa

How much myth is mixed with reality in the portrayals and retelling of this incident is unclear, but the following 1895 ""absolutely authentic"" account titled ""That Baby"" by a British writer is typical:1

...some of the soldiers found a well-nourished Chinese baby boy lying on the ground, and it was supposed  that the child belonged to the woman who had just been sent beyond the lines. Pitying the little fellow, who was crying bitterly, Captain Higuchi Seizaburo, of the Sixth Division, picked him up  and did his best to console the baby. But as the young Chinaman refused to be comforted. Captain Higuchi called up one of  the prisoners and told him that he, the Captain, would give him  his liberty if he took that baby to its parents. To this the Chinese captive, a stalwart fellow who looked as if he might have children himself, joyfully consented; but the baby refused to be  separated from its Japanese friend, and cried harder than ever when the Chinese tried to take it in his arms. So, holding the  baby in his left arm while he grasped his sabre with the right, Captain Higuchi marched to the capture of the next fort, receiving at one time a bullet through his cap. The fort was taken  in gallant style, the baby meanwhile looking on in wondering  surprise at the din and uproar of the battle, perfectly content to rest on the kind-hearted Captain's shoulder. When all was over this gallant officer gave his tiny charge to some of his troopers, who bore the child in safety to a Chinese house in a village hard by.2

In commenting on this incident historian John W. Dower notes:

Captain Higuchi became a symbol of the bravery and benevolence of the Japanese forces and, as seen here, was celebrated in a number of woodblock prints (often with enemy bullets streaking around him). At a deeper symbolic level, he exemplified the whole notion of a righteous war against China. The implication was that the child had been left in peril by its own irresponsible parents and caretakers. Thus, even as they were depicted overthrowing the Chinese, the propaganda message of such prints to Japanese viewers was that their fighting men not only were strong and resolute, but also were protecting and preserving China’s future.",n.a.,関口政治郎 Sekiguchi Masajirō [Marks: pub. ref. 462; seal not shown],n.a.,n.a.,,,"明治廿八年四月十九日印刷 printing:April 19, 1895仝    年仝月廿三日発行 published: April 23, 1895",Impression excellent,Colors excellent,Condition good - three separate sheets; trimmed to image; soiling; remnants of previous backing,Genre ukiyo-e;senso-e(Sino-Japanese War),Format vertical ōban triptych,n.a.,H x W Paper 13 3/4 x 9 in.

Kuzu root is the traditional medicine of choice for a host of digestive disorders and it is also used as a cooking starch.

Children and adults gather around a story teller dressed in an official-looking uniform in these three states of the post-war second edition, by the publisher Kyoto Hangain, of the original pre-WWII design published by Nishinomiya Shoin between 1939 and 1941.  As the original publisher Nishinomiya Shoin did, the post-War publisher Kyoto Hangain (the successor business to Nishinomiya Shoin) reprinted particular prints multiple times, resulting in a number of different print states, with minor differences, such as the absence of the print title 紙芝居 as we see on IHL Cat. #983.  Different printings also seemed to have used different papers and colors often varied between printings.

All three prints were placed in an envelopewith the above label adhered to it noting that they were “not for sale.”  It is likely these prints, designed by a nihonga artist who signed his name 守拙 Shusetsu,were commissioned by a nōsatsukai [anassociation of devotees of nōsatsu (Japanese votive slips)] and meant for distribution to members, hence they were“not for sale”. The names of the members of the nōsatsukai appear as small votive strips in the bottom portion ofeach print, 75 slips on each of the three prints. While the prints are undated,they are most likely a 20th-century production.

Fūjin and Raijin

Most often pictured as a pair, Fūjin, the wind god, and Raijin, the thunder deity, are portrayed as oni (demons), though in Buddhism both are attendants of Kanno, the Goddess of Mercy, and neither are inherently good or evil, capable of displaying both characteristics. Fūjin and Raijin are depicted in these prints in their typical poses of, in the case of Fūjin, grasping a bag from whose opening comes the winds and, in the case of Raijin, holding a circle of hand drums producing thunder.  The most famous, and oft repeated, depiction of the pair is Tawaraya Sōtatsu's (俵屋 宗達, c. 1570 – c. 1640) screen paintings belonging to Kennin-ji in Kyoto, shown below, which are a National Treasure of Japan.",,"unknown, but likely commissioned by a nōsatsukai",,,,,not dated - likely 20th century,Impression excellent,Colors excellent,"Condition excellent - some discoloration, possibly foxing to cover print and minor toning to all prints",Genre kōkanfuda,Format vertical ōban,H x W Image each print: 13 1/8 x 9 9/16 in.

The texture of the woodblock itself creates dappled tones and fragile shades.   The works are light, yet the source of the light is hidden behind fences and arches.  It is a light defined by shadows, creating a mood of timeless suspension.

Leafless branches cast foreground shadows, mysteriously real and abstract, stark and delicate.  The texture of the block, structural unity of the geometric ground figures, subdued coloration and shading, and magical, waving forms together create a locus, a place that is both definite and infinite, haunting and unassuming, vague and too vivid to be mere fantasy.

The texture of the woodblock itself creates dappled tones and fragile shades.   The works are light, yet the source of the light is hidden behind fences and arches.  It is a light defined by shadows, creating a mood of timeless suspension.

Leafless branches cast foreground shadows, mysteriously real and abstract, stark and delicate.  The texture of the block, structural unity of the geometric ground figures, subdued coloration and shading, and magical, waving forms together create a locus, a place that is both definite and infinite, haunting and unassuming, vague and too vivid to be mere fantasy.

While the fan design samples below were likely created in the Taishō and early Shōwa eras (c. 1912-1940), fan design samples date back to the Meiji era. They showed the season's available designs, commissioned from some of the most eminent artists of the day. Once the season was over, the sample fans and books of fans were sold. Most of the samples in my collection do not carry a signature or seal and the artists will be forever unknown, but some famous names do appear on several of the prints, such as the below prints Fish and Reeds, designed by Fukuda Heihachirō [福田平八郎 (1892-1974)], a nihonga painter who was awarded the Order of Culture, and Leaping Fish designed by Yokoyama Taikan [横山大観 (1868-1958)], another famous nihonga artist and Order of Culture winner.  

The designs range from Art Deco to traditional genre scenes.

The shape of these prints indicate they were designs for folding fans (sensu 扇子, or ōgi 扇 as they are also known.)  While often described as ""woodblock prints"", I believe most of these sample designs are hand painted or inked rather than printed, as on at least one sample a brush hair is embedded in the ink/paint and on several others the ink or paint has overlapped the paper edge and bled onto the back of the paper.

Some of the prints carry inventory numbers; some bear a cartouche with the word nambu (literally, ""southern region"" and possibly the name of a company) written in kanji 南部 or kana なんぶ, and some bear a fan-shaped cartouche with the kanji character 業 (""karma"" or simply the character for ""industry"" or ""business"") inside it, possibly the trademark of another fan company.

Most of the samples in my collection do not carry a signature or seal and the artists will be forever unknown, but some famous names do appear on several of the prints, such as the below prints Fish and Reeds, designed by Fukuda Heihachirō [福田平八郎 (1892-1974)], a nihonga painter who was awarded the Order of Culture, and Leaping Fish designed by Yokoyama Taikan [横山大観 (1868-1958)], another famous nihonga artist and Order of Culture winner.  

The designs range from Art Deco to traditional genre scenes.

The shape of these prints indicate they were designs for folding fans (sensu 扇子, or ōgi 扇 as they are also known.)  While often described as ""woodblock prints"", I believe most of these sample designs are hand painted or inked rather than printed, as on at least one sample a brush hair is embedded in the ink/paint and on several others the ink or paint has overlapped the paper edge and bled onto the back of the paper.

Some of the prints carry inventory numbers; some bear a cartouche with the word nambu (literally, ""southern region"" and possibly the name of a company) written in kanji 南部 or kana なんぶ, and some bear a fan-shaped cartouche with the kanji character 業 (""karma"" or simply the character for ""industry"" or ""business"") inside it, possibly the trademark of another fan company.

Three of four sheets of an e-sugoroku (pictorial board game), each sheet depicting three or four scenes of famous stories demonstrating moral actions to be emulated. Brief explanatory texts appear in the scrolls on each image, beginning with Empress Jinjū (shown in the lower right at the starting point, furidashi, who is said to have reigned from 201 to 269 and finishing at the goal, agari, at the top left, with Emperor Nintoku who is said to have reigned from 313 to 399.

Note that the sheet in the lower left corner, surrounded by a red border, is not part of the collection, but was part of the gameboard as issued.  In addition, the title of this e-sugoroku, 皇国史畧雙録 (Kōkoku shiryaku sugoroku, ""Brief History of Japan Board Game""), which is not present on any of the three sheets in the collection, is taken from the records of National Library of Australia which holds the complete e-sugoroku in its collection.1

The Stories Depicted in the Three Sheets in The Collection

Lower Right Sheet (clockwise from the lower right image):

Empress Jingū 神后皇后八 [神功皇后] (170-269)

On the bottom right in the starting square (with the characters 振出 furidashi above it) we see Empress Jingū (r. 201-269), wife of Emperor Chūai, fishing as her minister Takenouchi no Sukune looks on. This scene takes place after the death of the emperor, who died as he planned to invade the Korean peninsula. ""Jingū and Sukune fish for offerings to the gods, and the trout she pulls out of the river in this print is a symbol of good luck, indicating to the empress that she should take over her husband's planned invasion. Legend has it that while Jingū led the invasion, she was able to keep her unborn son contained within her womb for three years to protect him from the dangers of war; when the invasion ended, she finally gave birth to Emperor Ojin. Today, Jingū is venerated as the Shinto goddess of safe delivery.""2


Soga (Juro) Tokimune 曾我時致 (1174-1193)

One of the great vendetta stories in Japanese folklore, the Soga brothers, Sukenari (Soga Juro Sukenari) and Tokimune (Soga Goro Tokimune), take their revenge on their father's murderer, Kudō Suketsune, at the hunting camp of the shogun Yoritomo on the 18th day of the fifth month of 1193. In this scene, set after Suketsune is killed by the brothers and Juro has also been killed, the hot-blooded Tokimune is grabbed by the wrestler Goromaru. Tokimune is taken before the shogun and later executed.

This story is told in The Tale of the Soga Brothers (Soga monogatari 曽我物語) written in the late Kamakura period (1185–1333.)

Kojima Takanori 児島高徳 (1312-1382)

The top left image depicts Kojima Takanori, dressed in peasant garb, writing a poem on a cherry tree  to the exiled Emperor Go-Daigo telling him to not lose heart.

The story of Kojima Takanori and Emperor Go Daigo is told in the Taiheiki Monogatari, the Japanese historical epic written in the late 14th century.  It recounts how Takanori, a devoted retainer of Emperor Go Daigo (r. 1318-1330), celebrated in Japanese history for the Kenmu Restoration in which the bakufu was overthrown and power restored to the imperial court, came to the aid of the exiled Emperor.  

In 1331, Emperor Go-Daigo (1288-1339) was deposed and sent into exile by the Hōjō family. Takanori, a loyal supporter of the Emperor, disguised himself as a peasant and tracked the Emperor to the small inn on the border of Bizen province. As a message to the Emperor, Takanori rips a patch of bark off the cherry tree and writes a classical Chinese poem of loyalty, recounting how the King of Yue was saved by his loyal retainer, Huan Lei. Although the Emperor was heartened by the poem, it was two more years before he was reinstated.

The poem reads:
            天莫空勾踐 Ten Kōsen no Munashu suru nakare,
            時非無范姦 Toki ni Hanrei nake ni shimo arazu

Fujiwara Kunimitsu 藤原仲光 (active c. 1325)

In the upper right we see thirteen year old Fujiwara Kunimitsu escaping after he has avenged the death of his father by using bamboo to form a bridge across the mote surrounding the mansion of the Governor of Sado Island.  As the story goes Kunimitsu's father, Fujiwara no Suketomo, Emperor Go-Daigo's chief confidant, was exiled to Sado Island where he was killed on the command of the Kamakura regent, Takatori.  Upon hearing of his father's exile, Kunimitsu, despite his mother's tearful remonstrances, set out from Kyoto to bid his father farewell.  Although moved by the boy's affection the Governor was fearful of the regent and commissioned Homma Saburo, a member of his family, to kill Suketomo.  

""Kunimitsu determined to avenge his father, even at the expense of his own life. During a stormy night, he effected an entry into the governor's mansion, and, penetrating to Saburo's chamber, killed him. The child then turned his weapon against his own bosom. But, reflecting that he had his mother to care for, his sovereign to serve, and his father's will to carry out, he determined to escape if possible. The mansion was surrounded by a deep moat which he could not cross. But a bamboo grew on the margin, and climbing up this, he found that it bent with his weight so as to form a bridge. He reached Kyoto in safety and ultimately attained the high post (chunagon) which his father had held.""3

Three of four sheets of an e-sugoroku (pictorial board game), each sheet depicting three or four scenes of famous stories demonstrating moral actions to be emulated. Brief explanatory texts appear in the scrolls on each image, beginning with Empress Jinjū (shown in the lower right at the starting point, furidashi, who is said to have reigned from 201 to 269 and finishing at the goal, agari, at the top left, with Emperor Nintoku who is said to have reigned from 313 to 399.

Note that the sheet in the lower left corner, surrounded by a red border, is not part of the collection, but was part of the gameboard as issued.  In addition, the title of this e-sugoroku, 皇国史畧雙録 (Kōkoku shiryaku sugoroku, ""Brief History of Japan Board Game""), which is not present on any of the three sheets in the collection, is taken from the records of National Library of Australia which holds the complete e-sugoroku in its collection.1

The Play - Tenko
Source: A Guide to Kyogen, Don Kenny, Hinoki Shoten, 1968, p. 188-189.
Act 1: Waki - an Imperial envoy
          Shite - an old man, the father of Tenko
          Kyōgen - a servant
Act 2: Nochi-shite - the ghost of Tenko

A boy name Tenko has a wonderful drum which had come down from Heaven, but when this was taken from him to be presented to the Emperor he drowned himself.  An Imperial envoy tells this story and explains that as no one has been able to make any sound come from the drum since it was taken to the Palace, he has been sent to fetch the father of Tenko.  Together they go to the Palace, and when the father strikes the drum it gives out such a miraculous sound that he is promised a rich reward and a musical performance is arranged to placate the soul of his son.  When this is done, the ghost of Tenko comes and dances before them.",,unknown,,,,,undated but likely c. 1925-1940,Impression excellent,Colors excellent,Condition good - foxing throughout,n.a.,Format shikishiban,H x W Image 6 15/16 x 7 in.

Nakayama depicts a line of Jizō bodhisattvas, protector of children, within the temple grounds, with small offerings on the ledge beneath them.1 

On December 1923, only a few months after the Great Kantō Earthquake devastated the Tokyo area, Nakazawa along with his two friends, the poet Ishikura Suiyō and the artist Akatsuka Chūichi, began their pilgrimage to the thirty-three temples comprising the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage, taking seventy-eight days to complete the route.

For more information on their pilgrimage see the article Nakazawa Hiromitsu - Picture Album of the Thirty-Three Pilgrimage Places of the Western Provinces.

Comparison of 1925 and 1946 Issues
This collection contains prints from both the 1925 and 1946 releases. I prefer the earlier release which has a more painterly quality, likely closer to the artist's original drawing the print was based upon.

The Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage (Saigoku sanjūsansho junrei) 

Japan's most famous pilgrimage, originating in the 11th century, encompasses 33 Buddhist temples in Western Japan (Kansai region) dedicated to Kannon (bodhisattva Avalokitasvara), the Bodhisattva of Compassion, who hears the cries of the world and assists anyone in distress.

The 33 temples on the approximately 1,000 kilometer pilgrimage route correspond to Kannon's ability to take on 33 different forms. One hundred thousand pilgrims navigate the route in its entirety or part each year.

Note: For a listing of all 33 temples go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigoku_Kannon_Pilgrimage. To access an interactive map of the route and its temples go to https://www.thetempleguy.org/p/saigoku-33-kannon-route.html and scroll down towards the bottom of the page.

Nakazawa's view may either be the long entrance path to the temple grounds of Imakumano Kannon-ji, in the Higashiyama-ku district of Kyoto, or the path leading to its two-story pagoda, Isei-dō Tahōtō. This Buddhist temple is the fifteenth along the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage.

In this print, Nakazawa depicts the temple gate Niōmon at the entrance to Matsunoo-dera, a Shingon sect Buddhist temple and the 29th temple along the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage.

On December 1923, only a few months after the Great Kantō Earthquake devastated the Tokyo area, Nakazawa along with his two friends, the poet Ishikura Suiyō and the artist Akatsuka Chūichi, began their pilgrimage to the thirty-three temples comprising the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage, taking seventy-eight days to complete the route.

For more information on their pilgrimage see the article Nakazawa Hiromitsu - Picture Album of the Thirty-Three Pilgrimage Places of the Western Provinces.

Comparison of 1925 and 1946 Issues
This collection contains prints from both the 1925 and 1946 releases. I prefer the earlier release which has a more painterly quality, likely closer to the artist's original drawing the print was based upon.

The Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage (Saigoku sanjūsansho junrei) 

Japan's most famous pilgrimage, originating in the 11th century, encompasses 33 Buddhist temples in Western Japan (Kansai region) dedicated to Kannon (bodhisattva Avalokitasvara), the Bodhisattva of Compassion, who hears the cries of the world and assists anyone in distress.

The 33 temples on the approximately 1,000 kilometer pilgrimage route correspond to Kannon's ability to take on 33 different forms. One hundred thousand pilgrims navigate the route in its entirety or part each year.

Note: For a listing of all 33 temples go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigoku_Kannon_Pilgrimage. To access an interactive map of the route and its temples go to https://www.thetempleguy.org/p/saigoku-33-kannon-route.html and scroll down towards the bottom of the page.

About the ""Picture Album of the Thirty-Three Pilgrimage Places of the Western Provinces"" 

First issued in 1925 and reprinted in 1946, the 1925 album contains 58 prints and the 1946 album 59 prints. For detailed discussion of the two editions and additional information on the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage see this site's article Nakazawa Hiromitsu - Picture Album of the Thirty-Three Pilgrimage Places of the Western Provinces.

Museum Commentary:

Buddhist texts describe a tenko drum that makes divine music. In the play, an official in the court of the Chinese Emperor (seated in the foreground) relates how such a drum appeared in a dream to a woman when she conceived her son. The baby boy was named “Tenko,” and when a drum magically appeared, he could make celestial sounds. The Emperor demanded the drum for himself, but Tenko refused to give it up and was consequently killed. The drum then became mute, so the Emperor had the boy’s father brought to court to play it (the scene shown here). The old man mourns his lost son, and then beats the drum, which makes a wonderful sound that testifies to the deep love of father and son. Later in the play, the spirit of Tenko appears and dances joyfully. 

The Play - Tenko
Source: A Guide to Kyogen, Don Kenny, Hinoki Shoten, 1968, p. 188-189.
Act 1: Waki - an Imperial envoy
          Shite - an old man, the father of Tenko
          Kyōgen - a servant
Act 2: Nochi-shite - the ghost of Tenko

Aboy name Tenko has a wonderful drum which had come down from Heaven, but when this was taken from him to be presented to the Emperor he drowned himself.  An Imperial envoy tells this story and explains that as no one has been able to make any sound come from the drum since it was taken to the Palace, he has been sent to fetch the father of Tenko.  Together they go to the Palace, and when the father strikes the drum it gives out such a miraculous sound that he is promised a rich reward and a musical performance is arranged to placate the soul of his son.  When this is done, the ghost of Tenko comes and dances before them.

It is a mid-winter eve, the moon is full, and a heavy snow has fallen.

Written in the eleventh century by Murasaki Shikibu, an aristocratic lady of the late Heian court, the Genji monogatari (The Tale of  Genji) is considered one of the world's great  literary works. It became a source not only for poets but also for artists, who illustrated  scenes from the story in many mediums —  including books, handscrolls, and screens —  from the twelfth century into modern times.  The final  ten chapters are often distinguished from the  rest of the narrative as the ""Uji jūjō"" (The  Ten Chapters at Uji).

(1873-1910))",Kōtō 耕涛,unread seal,"In September 1896, devastating floods hit the Tokyo area after several weeks of heavy rain. Multiple rivers in the Tokyo area, including the Arakawa, Tone, Tama, Naka, Edogawa and Sumida overflowed their banks causing severe flooding. Water levels rose over 24 feet in some places leading to the collapse of a number of embankments and dams.  The flooding, which continued for several weeks, effected a broad area of Tokyo.

As the print's inset in the right panel explains (see below), the flooding was the worst in fifty years. The embankment of the Nakagawa collapsed and the entire area of Mukojima became a lake that could only be navigated by boat. Officials and police officers rescued people and did what they can to mitigate the disaster. 

Only the left and right sheets of this triptych are part of this collection and the left sheet of this collection's print has the information in the publisher's seal blacked out. (Although most of the information in it can be made out after image enhancement as shown in the Print Details below.) It is unknown why the blacking out was done and I have seen this on other copies of this print.

The scene depicted in this print includes the area around the Mimeguri Shrine along the Sumida River, whose torii is pictured at the top of the center and right sheets of the print.

During the Meiji Era up until the 1896 flooding, major flooding occurred in the Tokyo area in 1870, 1878, 1885, 1887, 1889, 1890 and 1892.1 This flooding, particularly the 1893 and 1896 floods, led to the passing of the first River Law in 1896, which ""brought centralization in river control."" ""The River Law assigned the central government as the responsible party for flood control measures that demanded large funds..."" leaving the local government ""responsible for ordinary flood management.""2",n.a.,Suzuki Kikutarō han 鈴木菊太郎版 [Marks: pub not listed],n.a.,n.a.,,,"October 1, 1896 [printed September 28, 1896] (as shown below)",Impression excellent,Colors excellent,"Condition excellent - full margins, unbacked, minor marks",Genre nishiki-e,Format vertical ōban triptych,H x W Image Right sheet: 14 5/16 x 10 3/16 in.

Number 191 of twenty-eight prints from the series Views of the Famous Sights of Japan (Nihon meishō zue) issued by the publisher Matsuki Heikichi in 1896 and 1897.  (For additional information on this series see the article Views of the Famous Sights of Japan.)  Two slightly different impressions of the same scene with a light blue replacing the grey sky.

Source: Kiyochika Artist of Meiji Japan, Henry D. Smith II, Santa Barbara Museum of Art, 1988, p. 108-109.
This print depicts one of the most remote places featured in the series and a location that Kiyochika may have been unable to visit in person.  It stands out as a particularly effective landscape in a series that overall is drab and uninspired.  Perhaps Kiyochika was most inspired by places that he recreated from second-hand images and information.

This location is a secluded mountain valley whose fame for scenic beauty was relatively recent, unlike the more established “famous places” like Futamigaura, Togonoura, and Nikko.  The discovery of newer sites of scenic beauty was the result of the enthusiasm among men of letters in the late Tokugawa (Edo) period (1603–1867) for traveling to remote places in search of beauty and history.  The plum trees at Tsukigase were made famous in Travels in Plum Valley (Baikei yuki) of 1830 by the Confucian scholar Saito Setsudo.

The vast plum orchard that Kiyochika shows in Inner Valley at Tsukigase is located along both banks of the Naban River, the name for the Kizu River in its upper reaches in the mountains of the Kii Peninsula.  Tsukigase (known locally as Tsukinose) is about ten miles due east of Nara along a stretch of the river running from east to west.  Some ten thousand plum trees line both sides of the V-shaped valley for over two  miles.  The trees were planted in the precincts of a nearby temple in the late thirteenth century, and later propagated in great numbers as the source of a dye extracted from the plum fruits.

The sight of the thousands of plum trees blooming in February and March is spectacular, and the white blossoms fill the valley with a heady fragrance, noted in the haiku concluding the text:

Spring in Tsukigase:
Bush warblers
Drunk with fragrance.

(Tsukigase no haru ya ka ni you momochidori.)

Kiyochika’s print is remarkable for the coloring-or rather the absence of it.  It is rendered almost completely in black sumi ink, which serves to heighten the sense of the whiteness of the blossoms; only the rushing waters of the Nabari River are shown in color, as streaks of subtle blue.",Number 19 in the series,Matsuki Heikichi [proprietor of Daikokuya Heikichi] with Daihei seal松木平吉大平[Marks: seal not shown; pub. ref. 029],n.a.,n.a.,,,February 1897 (Meiji 30),Impression IHL Cat. #340: excellent; IHL Cat. #1843: excellent,Colors IHL Cat. #340: excellentIHL Cat. #1843: excellent,"Condition IHL Cat. #340: fair - paper soiling, one spot of foxing in cartouche, full margins, unbackedIHL Cat. #1843: good - paper soiling, particularly in margins; full margins; unbacked",Genre ukiyo-e; meisho-e,Format vertical ōban,H x W Image IHL Cat. #340: 13 5/16 x 8 9/16 in.

""Purported founder of the kabuki 歌舞伎 theatre and subject of 17c genre paintings fuuzokuga 風俗画. Said to be a shrine virgin miko 巫子 of Izumo Taisha 出雲大社 in Shimane prefecture, she adapted the devotional dance, nenbutsu odori 念仏踊り and came to Kyoto to solicit alms. In 1603 she led a troupe of women in dances and comic skits near Kitano Tenmanguu 北野天満宮. Her original and erotic style of dance became a huge success and was labeled ""Kabuki,"" which derived from the late 16c colloquial expression ""kabuku カブク"" meaning ""shocking"" or ""forward leaning"". More specifically it was called Okuni kabuki 阿国歌舞伎. The erotic nature of this women's kabuki, onna kabuki 女歌舞伎, made it an easy front for prostitution. In 1629 the government banned women from performing and young men were substituted, but with the same result.""",,unknown,,,,,unknown,Impression excellent,Colors excellent,Condition excellent,Genre shin hanga,Format ōban,,H x W Paper 9 1/2 x 14 5/16 in.

While an actual newspaper called the Kagoshima shinbun would come into existence in the late 1880s, it had no relationship to these earlier prints and their publishers.

In this print by Adachi, one of several prints of the rebellion he designed, the battle of Yamagaguchi is depicted. The engagement being referenced is most likely the March 12 battle in the Nabeta-Yamaga area, about 30km due north of Kagoshima Castle, as summarized below:

[On March 12] Satsuma troops were defeated by [General] Miura's 3rd Brigade in the Nabeta-Yamaga area [about 30km due north of Kumamoto Castle] and withdrew to the right flank of Saigo's main force. The defensive position was thus extended by an additional five miles to include the district from Torisu to Takaba. The casualties, both killed and wounded, were approximately equal on both sides, each army losing about 4,000 men.1

Identified in the print in the red rectangular cartouches are the following soldiers of the Imperial Army and rebel brigades:

Ex Libris and the Sōsaku Hanga Movement
Source: Modern Japanese Woodblock Prints - The Early Years, Helen Merritt, University of Hawaii Press, 1998, p. 272.

Early in the sōsaku-hanga movement both bookplates and New Year cards became popular. These required small designs and appealed to those who did not feel competent to handle large blocks. They were, however, also produced by major artists.

...[T]he modern enthusiasm for bookplates is traceable to Europe, as indicated by the Japanese use of the Latin term ""ex libris."" The European revival of bookplates [in the late 19th century] spread to Japan through an article by Emil Orlik in Myōjō in 1900 during his stay in Japan.

Three color woodblock illustrations from the first volume of Shin'yaku Genji Monogatari, Yosano Akiko's
与謝野晶子 (1878-1942) translation into modern colloquial Japanese of The Tale of Genji (Genji monogatari), written by Murasaki Shikibu 紫式部著 in the early 11th century. 

The color woodblock illustrations for the four books comprising Shin'yaku Genji Monogatari were stitched into the books and it is likely, though no definitive proof exists, that the publisher Kanao Tanejirō printed additional copies of the woodblock illustrations to be sold as single sheet prints. This collection's three prints would be examples of this, as they do not display any evidence of having been removed from a bound volume nor do they display any of the toning present on many of prints bound into the books due to contact with their acidic translucent protective sheets also bound into the original volumes.

The vast majority of these illustrations depicted beautiful women (bijin) and they appeared as inserted frontispieces, illustrations to serialized novels, advertisements, promotional supplements, as well as cover illustrations.

While employing new technology, the use of inserted pictures in both magazines and novels during this golden age was a continuation of the use of woodblock-printed multi-color illustrations in magazines and novels of the prior late Meiji period, c. 1890-1912, during which time the use of traditional woodblock printing technology for mass reproduction dramatically declined.2 

Unfortunately most of the bijin kuchi-e found for sale today, as with all but two of this collection’s prints, have become separated from the original magazines they were inserted in, making it impossible to determine what they may have been illustrating. In collecting these affordable prints, expect to see a characteristic tri-fold as many of the prints were larger than the dimensions of the magazines they were inserted into.

The print is also seen attributed to the shin hanga artist Shoda Kōhō (1870-1946), but I think this unlikely. It does not appear in Crows, Cranes & Camellias: The Natural World of Ohara Koson 1877-1945, the closest we have to a catalog raisonné for the artist. This print has a small MADE IN JAPAN ink stamp on verso.

The fact that Muller's gallery attributed this unsigned or sealed print to Koson, however, does not ensure its accuracy, nor does the Smithsonian attribution, which is almost certainly based on Muller's.  The following paragraph from Crows, Cranes & Camellias may be instructive in understanding the existence of unsigned prints during the first part of the 20th century and the broader disorderly state of the shin hanga publishing world.",,unknown,,,,,unknown date,Impression excellent,Colors excellent,Condition excellent - slight toning; mounted in original presentation folder.,Genre shin hanga,,H x W Image 8 7/16 x 3 5/8 in.

The original 1925 edition, included the landscape, without a poem, as one of two end pieces in the first release of the album by the same publisher in 1925. (See this collection's print IHL Cat. #2413.59 Landscape from the Picture Album of the Thirty-Three Pilgrimage Places of the Western Provinces.)

The landscape depicted is likely associated with Nara or Kyoto.

Note about carvers: the above information is taken from the detailed information in the ADEAC system for the 1925 release. While the printer Okada is well known, the second listed printer 大倉藤太郎 is not and I can find no information on him.
     
 Note about printers: the above information is taken from the colophon included in the 1946 release. As to the printer Nishimura Kumakichi, given as one of the printers for both the 1925 and 1946 release, there is some uncertainty about the date of his death, although a birth date, either 1861 or 1862 [Guide to Modern Japanese Woodblock Prints, Merritt, p. 223], is generally accepted. A death date of 1941 is sometimes given and 1955 has been suggested, but Merritt provides no date of death. If he truly did the printing for the 1946 release he would have been 85 at that time. I could find no information on the second printer listed for the 1946 release 高木淸光.

Waki - a ferryman
Waki-tsure - a travellerKyōgen - his servant
Shite - the mother of Umewaka-maru
Ko-kata - the ghost of Umewwaka-maru

A ferryman on the Sumida-gawa is told by a traveller about to cross the river that following close behind is a woman whose mind has been unbalanced ever since her son was taken from her.  He therefore waits for her to arrive, and then begins to cross the river.  On the way, the traveller asks the reason for the crowd of people on the other bank.  The boatman tells him that they are there to perform a mass for a boy of about eleven years of age, the son of one Yoshida from the capital, who died there a year ago after being taken from his home.  At this, the woman weeps bitterly, and reveals that the boy was the son she is seeking. The ferryman takes her to the grave and when they recite prayers there, the boy's voice is heard.  The mother prays again and her son appears to her.  But when she reaches out for him he is no longer there, and with the coming of dawn he disappears again for ever.

Hōgon-ji, the thirtieth temple on the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage sits on Chikubu Island in the north of Lake Biwa, Japan's largest freshwater lake. 

On December 1923, only a few months after the Great Kantō Earthquake devastated the Tokyo area, Nakazawa along with his two friends, the poet Ishikura Suiyō and the artist Akatsuka Chūichi, began their pilgrimage to the thirty-three temples comprising the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage, taking seventy-eight days to complete the route.",Miscellaneous temple/print number 30 appearing in the right margin of the 1925 release,"Kanao Tanejirō 發行者 金尾種次郎 ;  publishing house Kanao Bun'endō 發兌元 金尾文淵堂, IHL Cat. #2313 and #2413.38 (1925 releases): 文淵堂版 [Bun'endō han] printed in lower right margin as shown left IHL Cat. #2252 (1946 release): no seal","Okada Seijirō 岡田清次郎Note: the album's colophon (seeAlbum Box with Print of Kannon IHL Cat. 2413)lists two carvers, the above well-known Okada Seijirō and 大倉藤太郎, possibly readOkura Tōtarō, who I can find no information on.","Printer IHL Cat. #2313 and #2413.38 (1925 releases):Nishimura Kumakichi 西村熊吉Note: the colophon for the 1925 album (seeAlbum Box with Print of Kannon IHL Cat. 2413)lists three printers, the above well-known Nishmura Kumakichi; 山県秀助, possibly read Yamagata Hidesuki, who I can find no information on, and 松本兄弟堂, a company founded in Osaka by Matsumoto Kisaburō松本喜三郎 in 1923, which I believe did the letterpress printing.

The original 1925 edition and re-printed 1946 edition print of the eighth of eleven appendices in the Picture Album of the Thirty-Three Pilgrimage Places of the Western Provinces portfolio, each providing information on three of the thirty-three temples that make up the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage. Each appendix sheet provides a sketch of each temple's honzon 本尊(enshrined principle image), its goeika 御詠歌 (a song/prayer recited by some pilgrims) and a haikai (comic linked verse) composed by the haiku poet Ishikura Suiyō 石倉翠葉 (1875-1938) who, along with the artist Akatsuka Chūichi 赤塚忠一 (1887-?), accompanied Nakazawa on his seventy-eight day pilgrimage to the thirty-three temples and surrounding sights beginning on December 11, 1923. The creator of the honzon sketches is unknown.

The three temples on this sheet (including their locales, using the old province names, and sangō 山号*) are: 

Settsu no kuni Fudaraku-san Sōji-ji  攝津國 普陀洛山 總持寺 (temple 22, 二十二)

Settsu no kuni Ōchō-zan Katsuō-ji 攝津國  應頂山 勝尾寺 (temple 23, 二十三)

Present in this depiction of, perhaps an imaginary event, are minsters of the Army and Navy and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner.

While the print's title reads ""New Imperial Palace"" (shin kōkyo), its location is the emperor's temporary residence in the Akasaka Detached Palace, where he hastily moved after a major fire in the Imperial Palace in 1873.

The vast majority of these illustrations depicted beautiful women (bijin) and they appeared as inserted frontispieces, illustrations to serialized novels, advertisements, promotional supplements, as well as cover illustrations. 

While employing new technology, the use of inserted pictures in both magazines and novels during this golden age was a continuation of the use of woodblock-printed multi-color illustrations in magazines and novels of the prior late Meiji period, c. 1890-1912, during which time the use of traditional woodblock printing technology for mass reproduction dramatically declined.2 

Unfortunately most of the bijin kuchi-e found for sale today, as with all but two of this collection’s prints, have become separated from the original magazines they were inserted in, making it impossible to determine what they may have been illustrating.

Kami Daigō-ji, a complex of some of the oldest temple buildings in Japan, is the upper precinct of Daigō-ji and is the 11th temple on the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage. Nakazawa presents us with a view of a shrine building with a sign on its post reading 西國第十一番靈場納経所 (Saigoku sanjūsan reijo nōkyō-sho), telling us we're visiting the eleventh sacred place on the Saigoku pilgrimage and a donation of money or a sutra can be left there. Off to the right we see a bluish stone marker leading the way to Iwama-dera 岩間寺, the 12th temple along the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage. 

Along with his two traveling companions, the poet Ishikura Suiyō and the artist Akatsuka Chūichi, Nakazawa undertook this 600 mile pilgrimage in December 1923, only three months after the Great Kantō Earthquake devastated the Tokyo area.

Nakazawa presents us with a view of a thick horizontal branch of the 600-year-old Yōryu no matsu pine tree behind a low wooden fence at Yoshimine-dera the 20th temple along the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage. The roof of a temple building is seen in the midground and the hills of Nishiyama stretch across the print's background.

On December 1923, only a few months after the Great Kantō Earthquake devastated the Tokyo area, Nakazawa along with his two friends, the poet Ishikura Suiyō and the artist Akatsuka Chūichi, began their pilgrimage to the thirty-three temples comprising the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage, taking seventy-eight days to complete the route.

Carver Note: the album's colophon (see Album Box with Print of Kannon IHL Cat. 2413) lists two carvers, the above well-known Okada Seijirō and 大倉藤太郎, possibly read Okura Tōtarō, who I can find no information on. 

 Printer Note: the colophon for the 1925 album (see Album Box with Print of Kannon IHL Cat. 2413) lists three printers, the above well-known Nishmura Kumakichi; 山県秀助, possibly read Yamagata Hidesuki, who I can find no information on, and 松本兄弟堂, a company founded in Osaka by Matsumoto Kisaburō 松本喜三郎 in 1923, which I believe did the letterpress printing. 
#2251 Note: the above information is taken from the colophon included in the 1946 release. I could find no information on the second printer listed for the 1946 release 高木淸光.

Note on Nishimura Kumakichi: listed as one of the printers for both the 1925 and 1946 release, there is some uncertainty about the date of his death, although a birth date, either 1861 or 1862 [Guide to Modern Japanese Woodblock Prints, Merritt, p. 223], is generally accepted. A death date of 1941 is sometimes given and 1955 has been suggested, but Merritt provides no date of death. If he truly did the printing for the 1946 release he would have been around 85 at that time.

On December 1923, only a few months after the Great Kantō Earthquake devastated the Tokyo area, Nakazawa along with his two friends, the poet Ishikura Suiyō and the artist Akatsuka Chūichi, began their pilgrimage to the thirty-three temples comprising the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage, taking seventy-eight days to complete the route.

Nakazawa presents us with a view of a small building on the temple grounds of Tanigumi-san Kegon-ji, the thirty-third and last temple along the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage, which displays a circular sign, blue with a yellow frame, proclaiming ""votive offering"" 奉納. Pilgrim's have attached prayer slips and prayer boards to its walls.

Perhaps this small building is related to the temple's Kannon, as described by Ian Reader:
Behind its main hall there is an enclosure housing a statue of the healing Buddha Yakushi. The statue is frequently swathed in clouds of incense lit by the many people who pray for his assistance in overcoming pains and sickness. To the side of the statue is a small kiosk where one can purchase strips of paper with Buddhist spells written on them: the purchaser then places the paper on Yakushi’s body and, while reciting a prayer, pours over it water from a ladle, thus symbolically washing the pain from the afflicted area.1

Nakazawa has captured one of his traveling companions in matanozoki, turning his back to Amanohashidate (""heavenly bridge""), bending down and admiring the view through his legs. Performing matanozoki gives the impression that the sandbar is truly a bridge to the heavens. 

Below on the right, we see a painting by Nakazawa, likely created at the end of his pilgrimage, similar to the finished print, shown left. The painting contains a poem by Nakazawa's traveling companion, the poet Ishikura Suiyō reading 丹後天の橋立翠葉またのぞき なかざわ.

It is known as the place where Kannon first appeared to Priest Ragyō Shōnin, the 4th-century founder of Seiganto-ji, the first temple along the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage. For centuries, holy men and ascetics have prayed under its plummeting water.

The falls form part of the ""Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range""—a registered UNESCO World Heritage site. It is one of Japan's three largest waterfalls and the waterfall with the greatest uninterrupted drop, 133 meters (436 feet). It is 13 meters across at its top ridge and its pool is 10 meters (33 feet) deep. The revered Kumano Mountains from which the falls flow are an impressive sight behind the falls.

The period 1914 through 1921 has been called by Kendall Brown the ""'golden age' of bijin kuchi'e”.1 During this golden age (and continuing into the 1930s), thousands of inserted pictures (kuchi-e), mostly printed using metal plate lithography and photo-offset printing, were commissioned from both well-known and little-known artists by publishers of mass-market popular culture magazines (taishū zasshi). The vast majority of these illustrations depicted beautiful women (bijin) and they appeared as inserted frontispieces, illustrations to serialized novels, advertisements, promotional supplements, as well as cover illustrations. 

While employing new technology, the use of inserted pictures in both magazines and novels during this golden age was a continuation of the use of woodblock-printed multi-color illustrations in magazines and novels of the prior late Meiji period, c. 1890-1912, during which time the use of traditional woodblock printing technology for mass reproduction dramatically declined.2 

Unfortunately most of the bijin kuchi-e found for sale today, as with all but two of this collection’s prints, have become separated from the original magazines they were inserted in, making it impossible to determine what they may have been illustrating. In collecting these affordable prints, expect to see a characteristic tri-fold as many of the prints were larger than the dimensions of the magazines they were inserted into.

Nakazawa has captured one of his traveling companions in matanozoki, turning his back to Amanohashidate (""heavenly bridge""), bending down and admiring the view through his legs. Performing matanozoki gives the impression that the sandbar is truly a bridge to the heavens. 

Below on the right, we see a painting by Nakazawa, likely created at the end of his pilgrimage, similar to the finished print, shown left. The painting contains a poem by Nakazawa's traveling companion, the poet Ishikura Suiyō reading 丹後天の橋立翠葉またのぞき なかざわ.
 
On December 11, 1923, only a few months after the Great Kantō Earthquake devastated the Tokyo area, Nakazawa along with his two friends, the poet Ishikura Suiyō and the artist Akatsuka Chūichi, began their pilgrimage to the thirty-three temples of the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage, finishing after seventy-eight days.",Miscellaneous print number 36 appearing in the right margin of the 1925 release,發行者 金尾種次郎 Kanao Tanejirō 發兌元 金尾文淵堂 publishing house Kanao Bun'endōIHL Cat. #2413.44 (1925 release): 文淵堂版 [Bun'endō han] printed in lower right margin as shown leftIHL Cat. #2464 (1946 release): no seal,"Okada Seijirō 岡田清次郎Note: the album's colophon (seeAlbum Box with Print of Kannon IHL Cat. 2413)lists two carvers, the above well-known Okada Seijirō and 大倉藤太郎, possibly readOkura Tōtarō, who I can find no information on.","Printer IHL Cat. #2413.44 (1925 release): Nishimura Kumakichi 西村熊吉Note: the colophon for the 1925 album (seeAlbum Box with Print of Kannon IHL Cat. 2413)lists three printers, the above well-known Nishmura Kumakichi; 山県秀助, possibly read Yamagata Hidesuki, who I can find no information on, and 松本兄弟堂, a company founded in Osaka by Matsumoto Kisaburō松本喜三郎 in 1923, which I believe did the letterpress printing.IHL Cat. #2464 (1946 release): Nishimura Kumakichi 西村熊吉 andTakagi Seikō (Takagi Kiyomitsu?) 高木淸光Note: the above information is taken from the colophon included in the 1946 release.I could find no information on the second printer listed for the 1946 release高木淸光.Note on Nishimura Kumakichi: listed as one of the printers for both the 1925 and 1946 release, there is some uncertainty about the date of his death, although a birth date, either 1861 or 1862 [Guide to Modern Japanese Woodblock Prints, Merritt, p. 223], is generally accepted.

In the last numbered print in the album, Nakazawa presents us with displays of various tablets, votives and scrolls that can be found inside Fujii-dera, the fifth temple on the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage, located in the outskirts of Osaka. For more information on the temple see Fujii-dera from the Picture Album of the Thirty-Three Pilgrimage Places of the Western Provinces.

On December 1923, only a few months after the Great Kantō Earthquake devastated the Tokyo area, Nakazawa along with his two friends, the poet Ishikura Suiyō and the artist Akatsuka Chūichi, began their pilgrimage to the thirty-three temples comprising the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage, taking seventy-eight days to complete the route.

ihl-2559,cew added 20220302 -needs extra cleaning,,CN Complete,Fan Design Samples,Bluebird and Fern,n.a.,,n.d.,n.d.,n.a.,n.a.,n.a.,"Fan design samples were created as marketing tools for deluxe fan makers.  While the fan design samples below were likely created in the Taishō and early Shōwa eras (c. 1912-1940), fan design samples date back to the Meiji era. They showed the season's available designs, commissioned from some of the most eminent artists of the day. Once the season was over, the sample fans and books of fans were sold. Most of the samples in my collection do not carry a signature or seal and the artists will be forever unknown, but some famous names do appear on several of the prints, such as the below prints Fish and Reeds, designed by Fukuda Heihachirō [福田平八郎 (1892-1974)], a nihonga painter who was awarded the Order of Culture, and Leaping Fish designed by Yokoyama Taikan [横山大観 (1868-1958)], another famous nihonga artist and Order of Culture winner.  

The designs range from Art Deco to traditional genre scenes.

The shape of these prints indicate they were designs for folding fans (sensu 扇子, or ōgi 扇 as they are also known.)  While often described as ""woodblock prints"", I believe most of these sample designs are hand painted or inked rather than printed, as on at least one sample a brush hair is embedded in the ink/paint and on several others the ink or paint has overlapped the paper edge and bled onto the back of the paper.

Some of the prints carry inventory numbers; some bear a cartouche with the word nambu (literally, ""southern region"" and possibly the name of a company) written in kanji 南部 or kana なんぶ, and some bear a fan-shaped cartouche with the kanji character 業 (""karma"" or simply the character for ""industry"" or ""business"") inside it, possibly the trademark of another fan company.",n.a.,n.a.,n.a.,n.a.,,,,n.a.,n.a.,n.a.,n.a.,n.a.,n.a.,n.a.,n.a.,n.a.,IHL.2559,IHL.2559,IHL Catalog #2559,,,,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,ihl-2559.jpg,ihl-2559_th.jpg,,ihl-2559_sm.jpg,
