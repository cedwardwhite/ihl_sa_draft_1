Probably the work of an arsonist, the fire spread rapidly, fanned by strong seasonal winds from the northwest.  Probably around daybreak, it reached the foot of Ryogoku Bridge, consuming Kiyochika’s home.  The fire was then driven across the Sumida River to the Honjo area, traveling south to Fukagawa until it finally burned out in the early evening of the same day after sixteen hours of devastation.  The greatest of all the many fires in Meiji Tokyo, it destroyed over 10,000 buildings.

This print was made in the 1950s by the Kyoto publisher Maria Shobo from recut woodblocks, copying the original 1881 design. Two series of Kiyochika designs, each consisting of 12 prints, were issued by the publisher.  The recut prints generally, but not always, have the publisher's identifying Ma character beneath the cartouche in the print's margin.  Maria Shobo was established in 1924 and continues to publish books.

""With a full strike force our men captured five enemy camps by 7:30 AM and the battered Chinese fled, leaving countless quantities of ammunition and supplies, including eight field guns.

The first Japanese soldiers landed on January 20, and on February 16 they were in possession of all forts and ships.  It was the most dramatic episode of the war, and nothing was wanting to enhance its spectacular effect. The hills encircling the bay formed a gigantic amphitheater from which the vicissitudes of the struggle could be observed.  Military attaches and men-of-war of the principal navies of the world followed with intense curiosity all the operations, and the Japanese, conscious that they were acting before a gallery of nations, determined to display, day after day, all the resources of their skill and daring.  In a few days the Japanese exhibited all the methods of modern warfare by land and ships, daring torpedo attacks which strewed the harbor with sunken hulls.  The Japanese never relaxed their relentless hold on the foredoomed fleet until the inevitable surrender came.

Though anecdotal and in a style that had lost popularity in Europe, it is curiously moving, precisely because of Toshihide’s ability to convey at once the grief and dignity of the defeated man.  Defeat, not victory, is the theme of most of the medieval Japanese war tales, and the heroes of Japanese history are mainly failed heroes.

""The moonlight night broke into a splendid dawn and revealed the Japanese army drawn up as if on parade.  The Russians did not respond to the opening of the Japanese fire, but remained silent and invisible.  The Japanese line of infantry, two miles long and entirely exposed, advanced from point to point by swift, sudden rushes, smartly executed in the most brilliant style, firing steadily all the while.  We watched anxiously, anticipating that each rush would enter the zone of fire.  The Japanese were working around the sides of Kiu-Lien Bay to their position when the Russian trenches suddenly poured a hurricane of rifle fire into them with deadly effect.

""For a moment the Japanese advance weakened and recoiled, then rallied and once more rushed forward across the stream, obtaining some shelter in a dead angle under the base of the mountain.  The Russians, not having guns, were unable to reply to the continuous fire of the Japanese artillery.

""The Japanese advance was marked now by prostrate bodies.  In one instance two Japanese shells did terrible execution among their own men, who were ascending the slope.  Two hours after the advance began an officer suddenly appeared at the top of the slope waving a large Japanese flag, sending an electric thrill through the beholders, all far and near shouting 'Banzai.'"" - Official History of the Russian-Japanese War: A Vivid Panorama of Land and Naval Battles, J.

It is unknown what battle is depicted, but as the title states this fierce battle happened in the vicinity of Pyongyang (Pingyang) it may refer to the below incident, cited in the 1906 account of the war by Great Britain's War Office. ""As a preliminary step, however, Pingyang, the most important town in North Korea, lying one hundred and fifty miles, or twelve days’ march, north of Seoul, had been already garrisoned.  On the 21st February a party of twenty Japanese infantry with a commissariat officer arrived there, and drove off a small body of Cossacks who attempted to enter the town… [A]nother company of infantry, with a commissariat officer was sent north from the capital , on the 15th, to prepare four line-of-communication posts.

It depicts the capturing of falcons using kasumi-ami in Iyo Province (伊予国, Iyo no kuni) which is now part of Ehime Prefecture on Shikoku.

Kasumi-ami 霞網 are stationary mist nets perfected for bird trapping in Japan in the late 1800s.  Originally made of cotton or silk thread, modern mist nets are constructed of black nylon.  Most are 6 meters long and 3 meters high.  These delicate, light-weight nets, which “disappear” visually against most backgrounds, are used both with and without mechanical or live tethered lures.  Mist nets are firmly suspended end-to-end from bamboo, metal, or fiberglass poles, typically in parallel or angled arrays.  Nets are placed in areas that are likely to attract feeding migrants, and in many instances raptors are attracted to the nets by already-captured passerines. - Migrating Raptors of the World: Their Ecology and Conservation, Keith L. Bildstein, Cornell University Press, 2006, p. 49-50. 

As with this print, the artist based many of his designs on the designs that appeared in the 1799 book Nihon Sankai Meisan Zue (Famous Sea and Land Products in Japan), leaving some question whether everything Hiroshige III portrayed in the series was truly the ""state of the art"" in 1877 when the series was issued.

It ""gradually became a more important production region for cocoons and raw silk, and by the early 1890s the value of the cocoons its residents produced surpassed that of raw cotton."" - Japan's Protoindustrial Elite: The Economic Foundations of the Gōnō,  Edward E. Pratt, Harvard University Asia Center, 1999, p. 117.

In keeping with the importance of sericulture to Japan's economy and industrialization, seven prints in the series are devoted to it. The Exposition was essentially an industrial promotion opportunity providing a meeting place for Western technologies and their Japanese counterparts. ""Silk production was the first example of an industry in which European producers deliberately sought out Japanese know-how"" and ""the source of Japan's first export technology."" -  ""Sericulture and the Origins of Japanese Industrialization"", Tessa Morris-Suzuki, appearing JSTOR, Vol. 33, No.1, January 1992, p. 1-2-103; p. 121.",,Ōkura Magobei 大倉孫兵衛 (Kin'eido; 1843-1921) [Marks: pub. ref. 627] - no publisher mark on this print,,,,,1877 (Meiji 10),Impression excellent,Colors excellent,Condition good - vertical center fold,Genre nishiki-e; kaika-e,Format horizontal chūban,H x W Image 6 3/8 x 9 in.

Bizen Province (備前国, Bizen-no kuni) was a province of Japan on the Inland Sea side of Honshū, in what is today the southeastern part of Okayama Prefecture.  Bizen borders Mimasaka, Harima, and Bitchū Provinces.  Bizen's original center was in the modern city of Okayama. From an early time Bizen was one of Japan's main centers for sword smithing.

The play is based on the Kyōwa era (1801-1804) incident known as the Enmeiin Affair, in which Nichido an actor-turned-priest used a secret chamber at the Nichiren temple Enmeiin to seduce a number of leading ladies from the shogun’s house. ""Nichido was first an actor but became the superior of Enmeiin, a temple of the Nichiren sect in Yanaka, and, with the aid of the priestling Ryuzen, enticed women thither, making the place a den of immorality, visited even by ladies-in-waiting at the Court.  That priests should break their vows of chastity was so common that no one gave it a second thought, but when we have a man who turned priest from actor and alluring women to his temple for immoral purposes, it throws a glaring light on the moral degradation of the age."" - The Economic Aspects of the History of the Civilization of Japan – Volume 3, Yosaburō Takekoshi, originally 1930 and republished 2004, Routledge, p. 173

Each of the prints is essentially a woodblock facsimile of what must have been an original watercolor created by Seihō, a Nihonga, Maruyama-Shijō school painter, rather than a print maker. In describing an earlier book of prints by the artist, also published by Unsōdō Publishing, Jack Hillier notes that the Meiji print-makers responded to the challenge of reproducing Seihō's watercolors, with ""marvelous interpretive skills"" and goes on to say “There is, in truth, a complete abnegation of the medium qua woodcut; its own virtues of bold line and flat wash are sacrificed in the cause of a facsimile rendering of a water-colour: this was a fundamental change in technique which led to incredible feats of reproduction…”","Also seen translated as ""Seihō’s Album of the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac""",Unsōdō Publishing 芸艸堂 ,, ,,,c. 1900-1915,Impression excellent,Colors excellent,"Condition fair - original album backing; original centerfold; toning throughout, minor soiling; corners damaged, 1/2"" tear middle of left margin","Genre e-hon,  fukusei hanga ",Format hoirzontal dai-ōban,H x W Image 14 1/8 x 18 1/4 in.

James A. Michener's description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
""That one soft-spoken man dressed in a Russian-type smock should have been able to capture in one print the essence of things Japanese must remain a miracle. Yet here in this apparently simple work Hiratsuka Un'ichi has imprisoned much of the timeless beauty that characterizes Japan.

""Artistically, the print is also an appropriate one with which to start a study of what is occurring in modern Japanese prints, for it is exclusively Japanese. Not a single alien component intrudes. The paper is a famous old make especially suited for prints. The ink is the same that has been for the last two-thousand years, made in the same way. The sever restriction to black and white follows the convention of the first great prints of Moronobu and his vigorous school of progenitors. Even the cutting of the wood is done with the same kinds of tools that the earliest artists used and with the same result in jagged line setting forth powerful solid areas. Technically, one can imagine this print to have been made three hundred years ago, and it is a joy to realize that what was so satisfying then remains so today.

""But beyond the chance components of the print, and its technical austerity, one sees depicted here one of the secrets of Japanese art: repose and serenity achieved by the use of tension and complete control. No more appropriate print than this could have been found with which to launch this book.

Hiratsuka himself offers the below commentary:
""The first idea that came to my mind in creating a print for this contest was to show a lakeside view of the Byodo-in. The impression I received when I first stood on the spot from which this print was conceived was so strong that it completely captured my heart. Hence I wanted to capture and present in the most powerful fashion that quiet moment in the afternoon when only the faint chirping of birds and the gentle rustle of falling autumn leaves could be heard. I have always believed that the motif of a print does not come through without inspiration, and that love and affection must accompany the carving and the printing. This work was created in that spirit.""",monochrome woodblock print on hodomura paper,"Charles E.

James A. Michener's description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
""Here Maekawa shows us a country girl holding a lamp at such an angle as to illuminate her very Japanese face. In subject matter the print is thus a pleasant combination of old and new. The face, the lam, and the texture of the cloth are from the permanent past; the pattern of the cloth and the saucy pony-tail hairdo are definitely modern. Thus from the first glance one sees that this print represents a visual compromise.

""Of special interest is the fact that the lamp throws upon the face a light which creates a masklike reflection, as if the artist had sought to convey by this subtle means the essential masklike character of the Japanese face with its large plastic forms, flat areas, and contrasting eyes. In no other country that I know have masks been so widely used as in Japan; religion and theater alike have made use of superb masks, and a collection of the historic wooden faces of the past centuries can be impressive.

""In fact, the most appealing aspect of this print is its honest use of print techniques, and no work that appears in this book is more wholly within the print tradition than this. It is composed, first of all, of flat areas of color applies in large masses. The girl's hair, her face, her costume, and the right-hand shadow running down the chimney are all large masses used as they should be in print-making. The construction of the right hand is especially interesting, since it demonstrates how solid masses of color can be utilized to create the impression of form.

""As for this print, it falls securely within the tradition that Maekawa long ago established for himself. The subdued color scheme is his. The touch of pink has been called almost a Maekawa trademark. And the winsome little girl is a sister to the hundreds of others he depicted. He was an artist with a feminine approach to life, indifferent to the tides of modernism that have swept his colleagues, and content to look lovingly at the village aspects of a land and a society that he obviously loved.""

Maekawa himself offers the below commentary:
""Autumn is my favorite season, particularly early autumn when the first cool days come around. In this print I fetched from my childhood memories of autumn days one of the lamps that we used to use and then perched an autumn insect on it.""

The following technical information is also provided:

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
""Through the long history of dance in Japan, its most brilliant moments have often been captured in prints, for theatrical subject matter has always been a major preoccupation with print artists. It has been estimated that about thirty-five percent of classical prints dealt with theatrical themes; of these, many of the finest depicted dances....

""It is therefore appropriate that one of the strongest prints included in this volume should be a present-day depiction of one of the oldest types of Japanese dance.  More here shows us two oafish comedians engaged in the kind of Shinto dance that occurs at shrines like that of Kasuga as interludes between the more grave and sedate religious evocations.  These comic interruptions have always been extremely popular with the common people, who must have found the hour-long religious dances somewhat tedious, for in time these ridiculous interludes gained a permanent home even in the Noh theater, from where they moved happily into the more robust Kabuki, where they now form one segment of almost every bill.

""Who these two yokels are I do not know.  Obviously they are the Oriental equivalent of Punch and Judy, of Bones and Sambo, of straight man and stooge.  One feels instinctively that they are engaged in some outrageous business, for they are the timeless comedians of all who work, the necessary interruption in any well-organized theater. They are instantly recognized for what they are, and one of most pleasant recollections in working with these prints came when a New York theatrical producer hurried through my living room, took one look at the prints here assembled, stopped before this untitled Mori and exclaimed: 'Ah, the comedians!  How I wish I could find a face like that one!'

""As a print-here, as in the terms of the contest, I follow the Japanese usage of so classifying stencils-this is a distinguished new work in an old technique.  As a conscious art form the stencil had all but died out in Japan, remaining only in such folk-art forms as the lovely bijigata stenciled prints of Okinawa, until revived in the present century by such men as Yamagi Soetsu, the father of Japan's now-flourishing folk-art movement, and the distinguished stencil artist Serizawa Keisuke, to both of whom Mori acknowledges a debt of gratitude for guidance.

""Here the stencil's bold line and heavy mass is made a decided asset.  The colors have a somber theatricality about them, and the juxtaposition of the two idiotic figures is cramped and crowded like the proscenium of an Elizabethan stage.  There is a fine sense of flatness about the print, and at the same time a sensation of weight.  An oil painting of these two comic actors or even a woodblock print, each with its own characteristic texture, would make them look entirely different.  This is a stenciled print, and the relation between colors, paper, and pigment is beautifully handled.  The harsh simplicity of technique is wholly appropriate.  The lack of shading and the reliance upon mass is appealing, and the total impression is one of quick message, vigorously delivered.

""In many respects this is a peculiarly Japanese work, for the although the figures might have stepped from some rowdy passage of the Italian commedia dell' arte, the manner in which they are depicted is purely Japanese.  The right-hand face, for example, comes straight from the puppet theater, and would be so recognized by any Japanese viewer, while the skirt and fan of the actor to the left recall both Noh and Kabuki.  Then, too, the use of these particular colors is indigenous to Japan, as is the placement of the seal.  This print could be as old as the dance itself.  It could date from somewhere back in the eleventh century, for it is a timeless product of Japan.  As such, it will be the last purely Japanese subject that we shall see in this book, and one leaves it with regret.""

Mori's commentary:
""This work was inspired by the comic Kagura dances given at Shinto shrine festivals throughout Japan. The dancers come onto the stage, generally a roofed outdoor platform in the shrine precincts, and to the accompaniment of the traditional drum and flute give hilarious pantomimes, which are also known as fools' dances. The idea for this print came from my fond childhood memories of such fools' dances.""

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
""From the moment the prints in this contest were assembled, both critics and general public nominated one as pre-eminent. This lyric, exciting work by Shima Tamami has an immediate appeal which does not diminish with familiarity. In color it is quiet and satisfying, each of its individual tones blending with the whole and each impressing the viewer as being appropriate to the subject. The use of wood in graphic art is nowhere in this series better exemplified than here, while the carved line is both artistically pleasing and technically expert.

""But what gives the print its inviting charm is the subject matter, a handsome, stylized scene from nature in which the three birds are splendidly varied in their attitudes, yet artfully disposed to produce awell-designed print. The brief suggestion of a woodland that runs through the middle background of the print is cleverly done, while the contrast between sky and water is beautifully achieved.

""This is a most adroit print, and I doubt if a better could have been found to illustrate in one brief example why it is that the modern Japanese print has been found so appealing by so many connoisseurs. The simplification attained in this work is admirable, but the depth of joy that shows through that simplification is one of the finest things that art can accomplish. I cannot imagine anyone's tiring of this rhythmic, plastic work, and if the reader should want a fine example of what the print form can achieve, this print would be the answer, for it is an almost perfect work.""

Shima's commentary:
""I have worked with the bird motif ever since I first took up prints. In the composition of the present print I treated the birds as still-life objects. I am not completely satisfied with this print because of its small size.""

This print is mounted in the Michener book.

James A. Michener's description appearing in the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
""This print is special in many ways.  First of all, it was done my Miss Iwami Reika, the first woman in the history of Japanese prints, so far as I know, to attain full stature.  It is true that Hokusai's daughter, an extraordinary girl known by the name of Chin-chin because her protruding jaw reminded one of the Pekinese dog (called chin in Japanese), issued a few works that gained wide circulation in the middle years of the nineteenth century; but she was never really much more than a curiosity, and her work was in no way commendable.  It is also true that today there are other fine women print artists who are gaining increasing recognition - Shima Tamami and Yoshida Chizuko, to name only two - and that there are now enough of them to have an informal association and to hold periodic exhibits of considerable worth.  But Miss Iwami represents the vanguard, and for two women to win prizes in a competition such as the present one signalizes a triumph of no small proportion.  It has never been easy for women to attain prominence in Japanese art, and for two such young ones to have done so is indeed an accomplishment.

""More important, artistically, however, is the second fact: this print exhibits a mastery of texture and color that is enviable.  The utilization of wood grain in the three standing pillars is very satisfying and gives the print a surcharge of emotion.  The printing of this passage and also of the background grays is first rate, skillful overprinting being used to bring out unanticipated textures.  In others of her prints, Miss Iwami uses a striking palette of burnt orange, crisp yellow, and flashing red.  Here she is more subdued, but her vivid sense of color values nevertheless expresses itself in the telling slash of red across the moon.

""The third reason why this print has a special significance in this series is that it exemplifies rather handsomely the best effects that are being obtained by the nonrepresentational artists in simplifying subject matter to the ultimate.  What more need by said about winter in Japan, where the wonderful texture of the unpainted wooden houses stands so starkly against the cold sky?  The resulting patterns are most satisfying, emotionally, and many people who have had an opportunity to live closely with others of Miss Iwami's prints can testify to the subtle gratifications one discovers in having them around.  They are somehow right; both the eye and the mind find them recurrently pleasing, and thus they satisfy one of the great purposes of art: they remind us of how simple the most effective measures usually are.  Miss Iwami utilizes simple means, simple design, simple, bold coloring, and out of this produces a complex, sophisticated whole that has the capacity to please without cloying.

""The final characteristic of this print that makes it special for me is that it was done by an artist whom I had the pleasure of helping discover.  All the men represented in this book were well-established performers before I came on the Tokyo scene.  Hiratsuka was producing fine prints before I was born, and Maekawa too.  Azechi was well into his third period - the portraits of mountaineers against stylized peaks - before I met him; and each of the other artists was well known.  But Iwami Reika was not.""","Four plywood blocks of basswood and lavan.

In the lower left image area he placed an abstract square seal printed in red ink with circle in white reservere and in the upper right of the image he printed an abstract rectangular seal in red ink with triangle in white reserve,"One of ten modern prints by ten different artists chosen for James Michener’s 1962 seminal work and portfolio of prints The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation, a work that brought the artists to international attention. This print is mounted in the Michener book.

James A. Michener's description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
""This calligraphic design by Maki is for several reasons an appropriate capstone to this book. For one thing, it demonstrates rather clearly the manner in which the younger artists are adapting the oldest techniques to their particular needs. [Maki]. . . gains much force by utilizing three different qualities of black: the traditional solid black in the upright stroke; a medium-force black in the lower horizontal stroke; and a handsomely mottled semi-gray black in the upper curved stroke. This wide contrast yields a most pleasing effect, and the eye is constantly lured from one of the variations to the other.

""A second deviation from old patterns is Maki's skillful use of three different textures of wood: the traditional solid, unblemished printing of the upright; the striking vertical graining of the lower horizontal; and the pleasing delicate mottling of the upper curve. Again, these textures carry the eye from one part of the design to the next, and when the variation in texture is wedded to the basic variation in the value of the black, a constant movement of symbol is attained, a kind of stately minuet of black and texture as forst one shape and the next takes command of the eye. Study the print for some minutes and watch this persuasive dance begin.

""The third innovation is, of course, the most important. This concerns Maki's skilled use of the calligraphic symbol as the subject matter of art. In the contest several artists submitted prints constructed from calligraphic designs: some were marvelous free-flowing constructions in which the ideographs which Japan originally borrowed from China stood out conspicuously; others were bold utilizations of ideographic elements but without quite forming specific ideographs that could be identified; still others were abstractions which contained the merest suggestion of a calligraphic base.

""The decision was finally made in favor of the present Maki. . . because its symbol was clearly derived from calligraphy yet so subtly modified as to free it from an obvious bondage. Furthermore, the symbol was used in such a controlled manner, both in coloring-texture and in disposition, as to remind the viewer that this was a work of conscious art.""


Maki himself offers the below commentary:
""This print is based upon the character 牛, meaning cow or ox. I have here tried to give our cultural heritage of such ideographs a modern feel, but in an Oriental style. This meant trying to capture the typically Japanese expression of the beauty of space, the sense of reverence for and persistent pursuit of boundless space, while at the same time taking advantage of the boundary provided by the beauty and life of the paper itself. The beauty of sumi, in it monochrome black, penetrates to the back of the paper and forbids decorative exaggeration or irrelevancies. This effect combines with a succinct and straightforward approach to create a space and an expression that, though intentionally compact, still have a quiet and gentle spread. The two small red seals are an integral part of the composition, providing color and a focal point and thus making the impersonality of the sumi's space deeper and wider and warmer.""

As with this print, the artist based many of his designs on the designs that appeared in the 1799 book Nihon Sankai Meisan Zue (Famous Sea and Land Products in Japan), leaving some question whether everything Hiroshige III portrayed in the series was truly the ""state of the art"" in 1877 when the series was issued. (Although for many activities pictured, things wouldhave looked much the same in 1877 as in 1799.) In many cases, the information in the scroll is also copied from the earlier work.

Historically, ""the Uji powdered-tea industry was so important that it received bakufu protection, and farmers had to sell their tea through designated channels.

The Uji district was famed for its tea plantations and its high-quality tea. Historically, the ""Uji powdered-tea industry was so important that it received bakufu protection, and farmers had to sell their tea through designated channels. Unlike farmers in other parts of the country, who cultivated tea on the footpaths between fields or on mountain slopes, Uji farmers grew their plants in groves. To produce a high-quality product, they latticed over their groves for superior grades of tea with straw or reed to protect the plants from the elements until the buds appeared."" - Japan's Protoindustrial Elite: The Economic Foundations of the Gōnō, Edward E Prat, Cambridge: Harvard Univ.

It depicts the capturing of falcons using kasumi-ami in Iyo Province (伊予国, Iyo no kuni) which is now part of Ehime Prefecture on Shikoku.

Kasumi-ami 霞網 are stationary mist nets perfected for bird trapping in Japan in the late 1800s.  Originally made of cotton or silk thread, modern mist nets are constructed of black nylon.  Most are 6 meters long and 3 meters high.  These delicate, light-weight nets, which “disappear” visually against most backgrounds, are used both with and without mechanical or live tethered lures.  Mist nets are firmly suspended end-to-end from bamboo, metal, or fiberglass poles, typically in parallel or angled arrays.  Nets are placed in areas that are likely to attract feeding migrants, and in many instances raptors are attracted to the nets by already-captured passerines. - Migrating Raptors of the World: Their Ecology and Conservation, Keith L. Bildstein, Cornell University Press, 2006, p. 49-50. 

As with this print, the artist based many of his designs on the designs that appeared in the 1799 book Nihon Sankai Meisan Zue (Famous Sea and Land Products in Japan), leaving some question whether everything Hiroshige III portrayed in the series was truly the ""state of the art"" in 1877 when the series was issued. (Although for many activities pictured, things wouldhave looked much the same in 1877 as in 1799.)

It depicts the hauling onto shore of a whale for processing.  The whale has been taken close to shore by a hunting party in fast chase boats (seko-bune 勢子船).
When this print was issued in 1877 near-shore whaling had given way to off-shore, or open sea, whaling.  By 1877 Japanese whaling was undergoing a transformation from traditional to modern practices forced upon them by declining near-shore whale populations. In traditional active whaling, whalers belonged to a specific whaling group (ōnaya) based out of a coastal village that had space on the beach for processing whales taken near shore (shore-based whaling). As inshore whale populations declined, larger open sea whaling ships were used to haul whales back to processing plants on shore and ownership of whaling operations passed to larger business groups, such as the massive Masutomi group, able to provide the bigger ships and on-shore facilities. By the 1920s factory ship whaling had begun in which harpooned whales taken on the open seas were towed to a centralized factory ship for processing.",,Ōkura Magobei 大倉孫兵衛 (Kin'eido; 1843-1921) [Marks: pub. ref. 627].,,,,,1877 (Meiji 10),Impression excellent,Colors excellent,"Condition good - margins trimmed almost to image, normal misshapen size due to chirimen process.",Genre nishiki-e; kaika-e,Format horizontal chūban,H x W Image 5 3/16 x 7 3/8 in.

Saihoji Temple belongs to the Rinzai school of Japanese Buddhism.  In 1994 the site was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Tradition holds that after being founded by the monk Gyoki in accordance with an edict from the emperor Shomu during the Nara Period [AD 710-794] and briefly occupied by Kobo Daishi during the Heian Period [1794-1185], Saihoji was revived during the Kamakura Period [1185-1333] by the priest Honen, who restored the temple and converted it into a training hall for Jodo Shinko (the Pure Land faith).  The facility was subsequently devastated by military conflict before being rebuilt in 1339 as a center of strict Zen ascetic training by the priest Muso Soseki with the staunch backing of the emperor Godaigo and the shogun Ashikaga Takauji.

The garden built by Muso Soseki (a nationally designated scenic and historic site) consists of an upper level of dry karesansui-style rock arrangements and a lower level built around Ogonchi Pond, which is shaped like the Chinese character meaning ""heart.""  Blanketed by more than 120 species of moss, the temple is popularly and affectionately known as Kokedera (Moss Temple.)",,"Uchida Bijutsu Shoshi with hexagonal seal reading Uchida han 内田版 [Marks: pub. ref. 558, seal 09-012]",,,,,not dated,Impression excellent,Colors excellent,Condition excellent,Genre shin hanga,Format horizontal ōban,H x W Image 10 5/8 x 15 3/4 in.

The color woodblock illustrations for the four books comprising Shin'yaku Genji Monogatari were stitched into the books and it is likely, though no definitive proof exists, that the publisher Kanao Tanejirō printed additional copies of the woodblock illustrations to be sold as single sheet prints. This collection's three prints would be examples of this, as they do not display any evidence of having been removed from a bound volume nor do they display any of the toning present on many of prints bound into the books due to contact with their acidic translucent protective sheets also bound into the original volumes.

When the bells were not in use, they were hung on wooden stands (as represented by the 木 character, meaning “tree,” which appears at the bottom of the gaku/raku character)."" - Yale University Art Gallery website https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/110323",,International Graphic Arts Society,self-carved,Printer self-printed,,,1957,Impression excellent,Colors excellent,Condition excellent,Genre sōsaku hanga,,H x W Image 17 x 12 7/16 in.

The color woodblock illustrations for the four books comprising Shin'yaku Genji Monogatari were stitched into the books and it is likely, though no definitive proof exists, that the publisher Kanao Tanejirō printed additional copies of the woodblock illustrations to be sold as single sheet prints. This collection's three prints would be examples of this, as they do not display any evidence of having been removed from a bound volume nor do they display any of the toning present on many of prints bound into the books due to contact with their acidic translucent protective sheets also bound into the original volumes.

This print is mounted in the Michener book.

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
""In 1957 the hitherto unknown woodblock artist Kinoshita Tomio, then thirty-four years old, startled artistic Tokyo with a series of large prints consisting of stylized human heads depicted in a striking new manner. Usually only black and one color were used, and those subdued, but both critics and buying public found the results immensely to their liking, and a new artist was launched.

""The chief characteristics of Kinoshita are well exemplified in this work, which is composed of severe geometrical patterns sensitively tied together into a pleasing design. The blocklike heads dominate the body of the print, but subsidiary geometrical patterns are utilized, as in the isosceles triangle that forms the chin of the left-hand face and the right-angled triangle that forms the hair of the right-hand head. The viewer is invited to find the other geometrical patterns for himself, and to see how cleverly they are juxtaposed in order to obtain maximum artistic effectiveness.

""From the moment of Kinoshita's initial appearance I have been partial to his prints, for they convey a sense of great simplicity and force, a combination which often produces enviable art. They have a universal quality, for as I have pointed out they could be of Renaissance derivation, yet they also represent the stoic modern man set grimly against an age he does not fully comprehend or approve. Weak though they may be when confronted with forces of darkness, these men display stubbornness and courage, characteristics which are perhaps more easily detected in square-block figures then in the elliptical ones.""

Kinoshita's commentary:
""A full title for this print would be 'Faces of the Weak Courageously Attempting to Move Forward in a World of Darkness.' This is one in a series of prints I have been working on for four or five years, all having the common motif of faces or masks. In combinations of faces such as the present I am trying to express the sufferings of society, of man, of mankind, of all living beings. I am not too certain of my results: perhaps in the end I have produced mere 'prints'"".

The prints and table of contents were housed in a red cardboard box with ribbon tie and sold for 25 yen.  

The box itself is constructed of cardboard, dyed red (and subject to bleeding). The front of the box is decorated with a print carrying the album's title 西国三十三所巡礼画巻 (Saigoku sanjūsansho junrei gakan) and a depiction of Kannon, the bodhisattva of compassion who embodies the compassion of all buddhas and is venerated in almost all Buddhist traditions. The eleven-faced, or headed, Kannon depicted on the print bears witness to the multitude of suffering of all sentient beings.

Neither the album's colophon or table of contents tells us who designed the cover print, but it may well have been Nakazawa Hiromitsu (1874-1964), the artist who conceived the project with the publisher.

In this print, titled Shin Kiyomizu-dera 新清水寺, the ""shin"" or ""new"" prefix differentiating from it's better known namesake in Kyoto, Nakazawa is focused on the path and small town beneath the temple. In the hills above the town Nakazawa shows us the top of the temple's pagoda. It is a charming portrayal of the mountainous area southwest Hyōgo Prefecture, often referred to as  Harima 播磨 or Banshū 播州, during the Taishō period.  Along with his two traveling companions, the poet Ishikura Suiyō and the artist Akatsuka Chūichi, Nakazawa undertook this 78 day 600 mile pilgrimage in December 1923, only three months after the Great Kantō Earthquake devastated the Tokyo area.

Pilgrim's have attached prayer slips and prayer boards to its walls. Perhaps this small building is related to the temple's Kannon, as described by Ian Reader, ""Behind its main hall there is an enclosure housing a statue of the healing Buddha Yakushi. The statue is frequently swathed in clouds of incense lit by the many people who pray for his assistance in overcoming pains and sickness. To the side of the statue is a small kiosk where one can purchase strips of paper with Buddhist spells written on them: the purchaser then places the paper on Yakushi’s body and, while reciting a prayer, pours over it water from a ladle, thus symbolically washing the pain from the afflicted area.""
