The Play - Kochō (The Butterfly)
Source: A Guide to No, P.G. O'Neill, Hinoki Shoten, 1929, p. 81.

A priest visiting the capital is admiring some beautiful plum blossom in the rounds of a palace there, when a woman unexpectedly appears beside him.  She tells the priest that she is in reality a butterfly and speaks of her regret that, although she can enjoy all the flowers that bloom in the other seasons, those of the plum which come in early spring are denied to her.  She asks for the priest's prayers to help her to attain salvation and then disappears.  That night, when the priest is resting beneath the tree, he sees the spirit of the butterfly perform a joyful dance because salvation has been made possible, and then watches it disappear again into the mist.

While the fan design samples below were likely created in the Taishō and early Shōwa eras (c. 1912-1940), fan design samples date back to the Meiji era. They showed the season's available designs, commissioned from some of the most eminent artists of the day. Once the season was over, the sample fans and books of fans were sold. Most of the samples in my collection do not carry a signature or seal and the artists will be forever unknown, but some famous names do appear on several of the prints, such as the below prints Fish and Reeds, designed by Fukuda Heihachirō [福田平八郎 (1892-1974)], a nihonga painter who was awarded the Order of Culture, and Leaping Fish designed by Yokoyama Taikan [横山大観 (1868-1958)], another famous nihonga artist and Order of Culture winner.  

The designs range from Art Deco to traditional genre scenes.

The shape of these prints indicate they were designs for folding fans (sensu 扇子, or ōgi 扇 as they are also known.)  While often described as ""woodblock prints"", I believe most of these sample designs are hand painted or inked rather than printed, as on at least one sample a brush hair is embedded in the ink/paint and on several others the ink or paint has overlapped the paper edge and bled onto the back of the paper.

Some of the prints carry inventory numbers; some bear a cartouche with the word nambu (literally, ""southern region"" and possibly the name of a company) written in kanji 南部 or kana なんぶ, and some bear a fan-shaped cartouche with the kanji character 業 (""karma"" or simply the character for ""industry"" or ""business"") inside it, possibly the trademark of another fan company.",,H x (W) x L: 8 5/8 (5 1/8) x 18 3/4 in.

ihl-1735,cew added 20220302 -needs extra cleaning,CN,,1912,Egyptian Hieroglyphics,c. 1912-1940; No. 67,anonymous,,,"Fan design samples were created as marketing tools for deluxe fan makers.  While the fan design samples below were likely created in the Taishō and early Shōwa eras (c. 1912-1940), fan design samples date back to the Meiji era. They showed the season's available designs, commissioned from some of the most eminent artists of the day. Once the season was over, the sample fans and books of fans were sold. Most of the samples in my collection do not carry a signature or seal and the artists will be forever unknown, but some famous names do appear on several of the prints, such as the below prints Fish and Reeds, designed by Fukuda Heihachirō [福田平八郎 (1892-1974)], a nihonga painter who was awarded the Order of Culture, and Leaping Fish designed by Yokoyama Taikan [横山大観 (1868-1958)], another famous nihonga artist and Order of Culture winner.  

The designs range from Art Deco to traditional genre scenes.

The shape of these prints indicate they were designs for folding fans (sensu 扇子, or ōgi 扇 as they are also known.)  While often described as ""woodblock prints"", I believe most of these sample designs are hand painted or inked rather than printed, as on at least one sample a brush hair is embedded in the ink/paint and on several others the ink or paint has overlapped the paper edge and bled onto the back of the paper.

Some of the prints carry inventory numbers; some bear a cartouche with the word nambu (literally, ""southern region"" and possibly the name of a company) written in kanji 南部 or kana なんぶ, and some bear a fan-shaped cartouche with the kanji character 業 (""karma"" or simply the character for ""industry"" or ""business"") inside it, possibly the trademark of another fan company.",,H x (W) x L: 8 3/4 x (5 1/4) x 18 3/4 in.

Tuttle Company, Tokyo",Reika Iwami (pencil signature lower right bottom margin followed by date),"One of ten modern prints by ten different artists chosen for James Michener’s 1962 seminal work and portfolio of prints The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation, a work that brought Shima and the other artists to international attention.

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation 

This print is special in many ways.  First of all, it was done my Miss Iwami Reika, the first woman in the history of Japanese prints, so far as I know, to attain full stature.  It is true that Hokusai's daughter, an extraordinary girl known by the name of Chin-chin because her protruding jaw reminded one of the Pekinese dog (called chin in Japanese), issued a few works that gained wide circulation in the middle years of the nineteenth century; but she was never really much more than a curiosity, and her work was in no way commendable.  It is also true that today there are other fine women print artists who are gaining increasing recognition - Shima Tamami and Yoshida Chizuko, to name only two - and that there are now enough of them to have an informal association and to hold periodic exhibits of considerable worth.  But Miss Iwami represents the vanguard, and for two women to win prizes in a competition such as the present one signalizes a triumph of no small proportion.  It has never been easy for women to attain prominence in Japanese art, and for two such young ones to have done so is indeed an accomplishment.

More important, artistically, however, is the second fact: this print exhibits a mastery of texture and color that is enviable.  The utilization of wood grain in the three standing pillars is very satisfying and gives the print a surcharge of emotion.  The printing of this passage and also of the background grays is first rate, skillful overprinting being used to bring out unanticipated textures.  In others of her prints, Miss Iwami uses a striking palette of burnt orange, crisp yellow, and flashing red.  Here she is more subdued, but her vivid sense of color values nevertheless expresses itself in the telling slash of red across the moon.

The third reason why this print has a special significance in this series is that it exemplifies rather handsomely the best effects that are being obtained by the nonrepresentational artists in simplifying subject matter to the ultimate.  What more need by said about winter in Japan, where the wonderful texture of the unpainted wooden houses stands so starkly against the cold sky?  The resulting patterns are most satisfying, emotionally, and many people who have had an opportunity to live closely with others of Miss Iwami's prints can testify to the subtle gratifications one discovers in having them around.  They are somehow right; both the eye and the mind find them recurrently pleasing, and thus they satisfy one of the great purposes of art: they remind us of how simple the most effective measures usually are.  Miss Iwami utilizes simple means, simple design, simple, bold coloring, and out of this produces a complex, sophisticated whole that has the capacity to please without cloying.

The final characteristic of this print that makes it special for me is that it was done by an artist whom I had the pleasure of helping discover.  All the men represented in this book were well-established performers before I came on the Tokyo scene.  Hiratsuka was producing fine prints before I was born, and Maekawa too.  Azechi was well into his third period - the portraits of mountaineers against stylized peaks - before I met him; and each of the other artists was well known.  But Iwami Reika was not.1",H x W Image IHL Cat. #895: 15 3/4 x 10 3/4 in. ( 40 x 27.3 cm) IHL Cat. #1336g: 15 3/4 x 10 3/4 in. ( 40 x 27.3 cm),H x W Paper IHL Cat. #895: 17 1/4 x 12 1/8 in.

Both prints are views within Nihonbashi, the most densely populated area of Tokyo.  The top print above (IHL Cat. #1280) provides a past, or old (古), view of the Yoroi Ferry, which carried passengers across the Nihonbashi canal to at Kabuto-chō to Koami-chō, Tokyo’s mercantile quarter of Nihonbashi, an area filled with warehouses stocked with rice, soy, and oil. It is matched with a present, or now (今), view on the bottom sheet (IHL Cat. #1290), depicting the Yoroi Bridge, built in 1873, that replaced the Yoroi Ferry.  In the present view, a gentlemen in modern Western-style dress can be seen. Interestingly, and confusing to me, is how the Yoroi Bridge, built as a Western-style iron bridge is depicted, showing no modern elements of steel construction.

These past and present views were orginally printed together as one oban-size sheet as shown below and later cut apart.  They are two of at least 32 views, contained on 16 uncut oban-size sheets, in the series Famous Places of Tokyo: Past and Present.

The Series: Famous Places of Tokyo: Past and Present
A series of at least sixteen uncut oban-size sheets depicting a past or old (古) view on the top sheet, and present or now (今) view, on the bottom sheet, of a particular area of Tokyo. Many of the views are similar to those found in Hiroshige's One Hundred Famous Views of Edo (Meisho Edo hyakkei).

What is behind this?  A.: This depends on the paper. Sometimes we use paper with our ""Do"" watermark, sometimes we use plain paper. But even in case a watermark is on the paper, you should know, there is only a single watermark in the upper left corner of each sheet. The sheet, however, has double oban size and is cut half before printing. Consequently, one print gets the watermark, the other not.

Fan design samples were created as marketing tools for deluxe fan makers.  While the fan design samples below were likely created in the Taishō and early Shōwa eras (c. 1912-1940), fan design samples date back to the Meiji era. They showed the season's available designs, commissioned from some of the most eminent artists of the day. Once the season was over, the sample fans and books of fans were sold. Most of the samples in my collection do not carry a signature or seal and the artists will be forever unknown, but some famous names do appear on several of the prints, such as the below prints Fish and Reeds, designed by Fukuda Heihachirō [福田平八郎 (1892-1974)], a nihonga painter who was awarded the Order of Culture, and Leaping Fish designed by Yokoyama Taikan [横山大観 (1868-1958)], another famous nihonga artist and Order of Culture winner.  

The designs range from Art Deco to traditional genre scenes.

The shape of these prints indicate they were designs for folding fans (sensu 扇子, or ōgi 扇 as they are also known.)  While often described as ""woodblock prints"", I believe most of these sample designs are hand painted or inked rather than printed, as on at least one sample a brush hair is embedded in the ink/paint and on several others the ink or paint has overlapped the paper edge and bled onto the back of the paper.

Some of the prints carry inventory numbers; some bear a cartouche with the word nambu (literally, ""southern region"" and possibly the name of a company) written in kanji 南部 or kana なんぶ, and some bear a fan-shaped cartouche with the kanji character 業 (""karma"" or simply the character for ""industry"" or ""business"") inside it, possibly the trademark of another fan company.",,H x (W) x L: 8 5/8 x (5 3/4) x 18 7/8 in.

There was only one printer active during all this time, Seki, who was dismissed by Doi Eiichi in the early 1990s for ""activities that undermined the Doi publishing house"" (no doubt selling unsealed prints on the side was a part of that activity).

About These Postcards
A set of three postcards created under the direction of Wada Sanzō (1883-1967) by unknown artists. The woodblock printed wrapper pictures a G.I. leaning against the railing on Kyoto's Sanjō Bridge. In the left corner ""Hori"" is printed, but it is unknown if this is the mark of the artist who created this design. The Japanese writing on the wrapper reads 木版絵葉書  アメリカの兵隊さんと 新日本風景 和田三造 補修, which can be translated as ""woodblock postcards, Scenic Views of American Soldiers in New Japan (or Sketches of G.I. in Japan), Wada Sanzō, complemented.""  The meaning of ""complemented"" [補修 hoshū] is unclear. Lawrence Smith states ""The involvement of the quite celebrated artist Wada Sanzō (1883-1968) in this series is not clear from the text, where the term ‘complemented’ (hoshu) might imply either ‘added to’ or ‘added by’.""1 While each of the three postcards is signed (see ""Artists"" under ""Print Details"" below), the artists are unknown.

All of the postcards display some aspect of cooperation between the Japanese and their American occupiers following the war.

Sanjō Bridge in Kyoto - Smith goes on to say ""On one of the favourite tourist spots in Kyoto, three G.I.s have obviously just been enjoying the sight of two passing 'maiko' (the Kyoto variety of a 'geisha').""2 

Japanese Coming Home on Hakata Pier - civilians are seen disembarking from the ship named the ""Dockwiler"" at Hakata Pier in Fukuoka.  The ship is likely the Liberty Ship the S.S. John Dockweiler, launched in January 1944. Hakata was a major processing center for Japanese ""displaced persons"" who had been repatriated from China, Korea and other former Japanese colonies with the help of U.S. ships following Japan's defeat.  The repatriation effort started in March 1946 and the Hakata processing center was closed by the end of 1948, making the publication date of these postcards likely in that period.3

A Snowy Sight at Hibiya Junction in Tokyo - an occupation soldier and a Japanese policeman join in directing traffic at busy Hibiya Junction.  They seem to be waving to each other in a comradely way, further evidence of the harmonious relations between defeated Japan and the occupation forces depicted in these postcards.",,H x W Paper 3 1/2 x 5 1/2 in.

Both prints are views within Nihonbashi, the most densely populated area of Tokyo.  The top print above (IHL Cat. #1280) provides a past, or old (古), view of the Yoroi Ferry, which carried passengers across the Nihonbashi canal to at Kabuto-chō to Koami-chō, Tokyo’s mercantile quarter of Nihonbashi, an area filled with warehouses stocked with rice, soy, and oil. It is matched with a present, or now (今), view on the bottom sheet (IHL Cat. #1290), depicting the Yoroi Bridge, built in 1873, that replaced the Yoroi Ferry.  In the present view, a gentlemen in modern Western-style dress can be seen. Interestingly, and confusing to me, is how the Yoroi Bridge, built as a Western-style iron bridge is depicted, showing no modern elements of steel construction.

These past and present views were orginally printed together as one oban-size sheet as shown below and later cut apart.  They are two of at least 32 views, contained on 16 uncut oban-size sheets, in the series Famous Places of Tokyo: Past and Present.

The Series: Famous Places of Tokyo: Past and Present
A series of at least sixteen uncut oban-size sheets depicting a past or old (古) view on the top sheet, and present or now (今) view, on the bottom sheet, of a particular area of Tokyo. Many of the views are similar to those found in Hiroshige's One Hundred Famous Views of Edo (Meisho Edo hyakkei).

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
That one soft-spoken man dressed in a Russian-type smock should have been able to capture in one print the essence of things Japanese must remain a miracle. Yet here in this apparently simple work Hiratsuka Un'ichi has imprisoned much of the timeless beauty that characterizes Japan.

Artistically, the print is also an appropriate one with which to start a study of what is occurring in modern Japanese prints, for it is exclusively Japanese. Not a single alien component intrudes. The paper is a famous old make especially suited for prints. The ink is the same that has been for the last two-thousand years, made in the same way. The sever restriction to black and white follows the convention of the first great prints of Moronobu and his vigorous school of progenitors. Even the cutting of the wood is done with the same kinds of tools that the earliest artists used and with the same result in jagged line setting forth powerful solid areas. Technically, one can imagine this print to have been made three hundred years ago, and it is a joy to realize that what was so satisfying then remains so today.

But beyond the chance components of the print, and its technical austerity, one sees depicted here one of the secrets of Japanese art: repose and serenity achieved by the use of tension and complete control. No more appropriate print than this could have been found with which to launch this book.

Hiratsuka himself offers the below commentary:

The first idea that came to my mind in creating a print for this contest was to show a lakeside view of the Byodo-in. The impression I received when I first stood on the spot from which this print was conceived was so strong that it completely captured my heart. Hence I wanted to capture and present in the most powerful fashion that quiet moment in the afternoon when only the faint chirping of birds and the gentle rustle of falling autumn leaves could be heard. I have always believed that the motif of a print does not come through without inspiration, and that love and affection must accompany the carving and the printing. This work was created in that spirit.

The following technical information is also provided:

Artist's title: ""Byodo-in Chihan"" (Byodo-in Lakeside). Carved on a single board of honoki (Magnolia oborata T.) with a single flat chisel, seven millimeters wide, called an aisuki.

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
Here Maekawa shows us a country girl holding a lamp at such an angle as to illuminate her very Japanese face. In subject matter the print is thus a pleasant combination of old and new. The face, the lam, and the texture of the cloth are from the permanent past; the pattern of the cloth and the saucy pony-tail hairdo are definitely modern. Thus from the first glance one sees that this print represents a visual compromise.

Of special interest is the fact that the lamp throws upon the face a light which creates a masklike reflection, as if the artist had sought to convey by this subtle means the essential masklike character of the Japanese face with its large plastic forms, flat areas, and contrasting eyes. In no other country that I know have masks been so widely used as in Japan; religion and theater alike have made use of superb masks, and a collection of the historic wooden faces of the past centuries can be impressive.

In fact, the most appealing aspect of this print is its honest use of print techniques, and no work that appears in this book is more wholly within the print tradition than this. It is composed, first of all, of flat areas of color applies in large masses. The girl's hair, her face, her costume, and the right-hand shadow running down the chimney are all large masses used as they should be in print-making. The construction of the right hand is especially interesting, since it demonstrates how solid masses of color can be utilized to create the impression of form.

As for this print, it falls securely within the tradition that Maekawa long ago established for himself. The subdued color scheme is his. The touch of pink has been called almost a Maekawa trademark. And the winsome little girl is a sister to the hundreds of others he depicted. He was an artist with a feminine approach to life, indifferent to the tides of modernism that have swept his colleagues, and content to look lovingly at the village aspects of a land and a society that he obviously loved.1

Maekawa himself offers the below commentary:
Autumn is my favorite season, particularly early autumn when the first cool days come around. In this print I fetched from my childhood memories of autumn days one of the lamps that we used to use and then perched an autumn insect on it.2

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
Through the long history of dance in Japan, its most brilliant moments have often been captured in prints, for theatrical subject matter has always been a major preoccupation with print artists. It has been estimated that about thirty-five percent of classical prints dealt with theatrical themes; of these, many of the finest depicted dances....

It is therefore appropriate that one of the strongest prints included in this volume should be a present-day depiction of one of the oldest types of Japanese dance.  More here shows us two oafish comedians engaged in the kind of Shinto dance that occurs at shrines like that of Kasuga as interludes between the more grave and sedate religious evocations.  These comic interruptions have always been extremely popular with the common people, who must have found the hour-long religious dances somewhat tedious, for in time these ridiculous interludes gained a permanent home even in the Noh theater, form where they moved happily into the more robust Kabuki, where they now form one segment of almost every bill.

Who these two yokels are I do not know.  Obviously they are the Oriental equivalent of Punch and Judy, of Bones and Sambo, of straight man and stooge.  One feels instinctively that they are engaged in some outrageous business, for they are the timeless comedians of all who work, the necessary interruption in any well-organized theater.  They are instantly recognized for what they are, and one of most pleasant recollections in working with these prints came when a New York theatrical producer hurried through my living room, took one look at the prints here assembled, stopped before this untitled Mori and exclaimed: ""Ah, the comedians!  How I wish I could find a face like that one!""

As a print-here, as in the terms of the contest, I follow the Japanese usage of so classifying stencils-this is a distinguished new work in an old technique.  As a conscious art form the stencil had all but died out in Japan, remaining only in such folk-art forms as the lovely bijigata stenciled prints of Okinawa, until revived in the present century by such men as Yamagi Soetsu, the father of Japan's now-flourishing folk-art movement, and the distinguished stencil artist Serizawa Keisuke, to both of whom Mori acknowledges a debt of gratitude for guidance.

Here the stencil's bold line and heavy mass is made a decided asset.  The colors have a somber theatricality about them, and the juxtaposition of the two idiotic figures is cramped and crowded like the proscenium of an Elizabethan stage.  There is a fine sense of flatness about the print, and at the same time a sensation of weight.  An oil painting of these two comic actors or even a woodblock print, each with its own characteristic texture, would make them look entirely different.  This is a stenciled print, and the relation between colors, paper, and pigment is beautifully handled.  The harsh simplicity of technique is wholly appropriate.  The lack of shading and the reliance upon mass is appealing, and the total impression is one of quick message, vigorously delivered.

In many respects this is a peculiarly Japanese work, for the although the figures might have stepped from some rowdy passage of the Italian commedia dell' arte, the manner in which they are depicted is purely Japanese.  The right-hand face, for example, comes straight from the puppet theater, and would be so recognized by any Japanese viewer, while the skirt and fan of the actor to the left recall both Noh and Kabuki.  Then, too, the use of these particular colors is indigenous to Japan, as is the placement of the seal.  This print could be as old as the dance itself.  It could date from somewhere back in the eleventh century, for it is a timeless product of Japan.  As such, it will be the last purely Japanese subject that we shall see in this book, and one leaves it with regret.

Mori's commentary:
This work was inspired by the comic Kagura dances given at Shinto shrine festivals throughout Japan. The dancers come onto the stage, generally a roofed outdoor platform in the shrine precincts, and to the accompaniment of the traditional drum and flute give hilarious pantomimes, which are also known as fools' dances. The idea for this print came from my fond childhood memories of such fools' dances.

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
In 1957 the hitherto unknown woodblock artist Kinoshita Tomio, then thirty-four years old, startled artistic Tokyo with a series of large prints consisting of stylized human heads depicted in a striking new manner. Usually only black and one color were used, and those subdued, but both critics and buying public found the results immensely to their liking, and a new artist was launched.

The chief characteristics of Kinoshita are well exemplified in this work, which is composed of severe geometrical patterns sensitively tied together into a pleasing design. The blocklike heads dominate the body of the print, but subsidiary geometrical patterns are utilized, as in the isosceles triangle that forms the chin of the left-hand face and the right-angled triangle that forms the hair of the right-hand head. The viewer is invited to find the other geometrical patterns for himself, and to see how cleverly they are juxtaposed in order to obtain maximum artistic effectiveness.

From the moment of Kinoshita's initial appearance I have been partial to his prints, for they convey a sense of great simplicity and force, a combination which often produces enviable art. They have a universal quality, for as I have pointed out they could be of Renaissance derivation, yet they also represent the stoic modern man set grimly against an age he does not fully comprehend or approve. Weak though they may be when confronted with forces of darkness, these men display stubbornness and courage, characteristics which are perhaps more easily detected in square-block figures then in the elliptical ones.1 [My note: reference the artist's biography and the print Big Boys,1958 for an example of Kinoshita's elliptical heads.]

Kinoshita's commentary:
A full title for this print would be ""Faces of the Weak Courageously Attempting to Move Forward in a World of Darkness."" This is one in a series of prints I have been working on for four or five years, all having the common motif of faces or masks. In combinations of faces such as the present I am trying to express the sufferings of society, of man, of mankind, of all living beings. I am not too certain of my results: perhaps in the end I have produced mere ""prints"".2

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
From the moment the prints in this contest were assembled,both critics and general public nominated one as pre-eminent. This lyric,exciting work by Shima Tamami has an immediate appeal which does not diminishwith familiarity. In color it is quiet and satisfying, each of its individualtones blending with the whole and each impressing the viewer as beingappropriate to the subject. The use of wood in graphic art is nowhere in thisseries better exemplified than here, while the carved line is both artisticallypleasing and technically expert.

But what gives the print its inviting charm is the subjectmatter, a handsome, stylized scene from nature in which the three birds aresplendidly varied in their attitudes, yet artfully disposed to produce awell-designed print. The brief suggestion of a woodland that runs through themiddle background of the print is cleverly done, while the contrast between skyand water is beautifully achieved.

This is a most adroit print, and I doubt if a better couldhave been found to illustrate in one brief example why it is that the modernJapanese print has been found so appealing by so many connoisseurs. Thesimplification attained in this work is admirable, but the depth of joy thatshows through that simplification is one of the finest things that art canaccomplish. I cannot imagine anyone's tiring of this rhythmic, plastic work,and if the reader should want a fine example of what the print form canachieve, this print would be the answer, for it is an almost perfect work.

There are many aspects of this print that will repay closestudy, but I should like to deal with only three: design, texture, and use ofwood.

Start with the outermost extremities of the bills of thethree birds, and see how, beginning with the one farthest away, the tips standeach at a similar distance from the top and the right-hand side of the paper'sedge, a distance which is repeated with the bottom and tail of the foremostbird. These points, taken in sequence from upper left, across the top of theprint and down the foremost bird's extended neck and around to his tail, formthe outside rhythmic pattern inside which the body of the print is confined.The three-quarter circle thus subtended is broken twice, once by the arbitraryintrusion of the band of woodland scene that cuts the right margin just belowthe middle, and again by the tail of the middle bird. When I first saw thisprint I liked the use of the bird's tail to break the rhythm very much, but Ithought the use of the light band somewhat arbitrary; now that I know the printmore intimately, I see that Shima was correct and that without that boldcutting of the pattern, the circle would look rather obvious.

To continue the discussion of the design, the placement ofthe three birds within the circle seems inspired. What differentiation theartist achieves, what variation in weight and balance, what a superbutilization of line to create form and implied movement! The three postures ofthe bills are a little obvious, I am afraid, but the extremely bold invention ofthe forefront bird in contorted sweep is something that most of us would havebeen quite incapable of. If the three bills are to be questioned as obvious,certainly that wild bird in front must be warmly commended as excellentartistic invention.

The manner in which the dark lower portion of the rear bird,as it intersects the band of forest, assumes the focal point of interest islikewise admirable; a lesser artist would have had his center of interest muchhigher and would thus have lost the relationship between the rear bird and thedominant forefront one. And the manner in which the middle bird ties the wholeinterior design together is commendable. The rhythm obtained by these variousdevices is positively insidious, for the beholder's eye keeps sweeping roundand round this picture, like a bird in flight.

One of the most attractive elements in this print is thevaried texture, divided into five contrasting types. There is the soft fleecyeffect of the sky, achieved by utilizing one distinct kind of wood creatively.There is the rippling texture of the water, achieved by using a different woodquite differently. There is the neutral texture of the band of forest whichheightens the contrast between sky and water. There is the glossy texture ofthe solid black portions of the birds. And there is the very effective mottledtexture on the backs of the first and second birds, obtained from a paper blockprinted in black over blue.

One would be most naive to assume that these contrasts wereaccidentally obtained. That they were so adroitly managed is a tribute to theartist, but also a reminder of how important texture has become in many modernJapanese prints. In this print the textures are tactile. One can feel with hisforefinger the different effects Shima is after. In Kinoshita's""Faces"" the texture is implied. In the print before that, Watanabe'smysterious figure of a man, the texture derives from the rough paper and theeven rougher application of colors. Three other artists not represented in thisbook who specialize in superb texturing of their prints are Mizufune, Nakayama,and Ono. Sometimes even to see the contrasts they obtain is pleasing,regardless of the subject matter of the print.

But few prints, even those by artists who have stressed thisaspect of art, have equaled Shima's use of texture as evidenced in this print,and much of the attractive quality which marks this work stems from its realand implied textures. Graphic art which ignores this problem today foregoes oneof its richest components.

The most distinctive aspect of this print, however, is itsuse of wood. On pieces of plywood, which is now customarily used by Japaneseartists since the original cherrywood block has proven too small and too hardfor the effects the modern artists desire, Shima found, for the upper half ofher background, a widely spaced, freely moving grain that resembled clouds and,for the lower, a rippling and more tightly spaced grain to suggest water. Withspecial pigments that emphasize the grain of the wood, she has obtainedprinting surfaces capable of recreating two quite distinct effects. The band ofdifferent texture thrown across the meeting line of the two woods wasbrilliantly conceived and eliminates what might otherwise have been a rathertransparent device: the harsh juxtaposition of the sky and water.

Shima's use of the broad-sweeping grain in the upper half ofher print was by no means a modern invention. It was used with marvelous effectas early as 1750 by the classical artist Ishikawa Toyonobu, who did severalprints with such backgrounds, and in 1765 by Suzuki Harunobu, who designed oneof his masterpieces, a dancer with a monkey, with a similar marbled background.In later works, especially those by Katsukawa Shun'ei and Utagawa Toyokuni,some designs, while not actually emphasizing the exposed grain of the wood, didstrive after somewhat similar effects by pressing the printing baren so harshly upon the wetted paperas to leave printing marks on the larger background areas. Such marks were heldto be artistically desirable, in that they reminded the viewer that the printhad sprung from a block of wood.

And here we are right back where we were in our reflectionsupon the preceding print, where Kinoshita Tomio carved an ordinary piece ofwood so as to impart the sense of oak to his print. Here Shima Tamami has donejust the opposite; she has searched for sheets of plywood which were sofortuitously constructed that they could hardly help but impart to their printa real sense of woodiness. Without in any way denying the beauty and power ofShima's results, of the two artistic techniques I still prefer Kinoshita's. Ihave already, in my remarks on his ""Faces,"" given my rationale forthis judgment. So in all fairness to Shima I should also admit to a subjectiveand quite irrelevant prejudice.

Japan has always had a group of craftsmen who search fortsuga (spruce-hemlock) wood of interesting texture. They char it in a fire,then rub away the burned pith, leaving myriad little black ridges against ahandsome dark-brown underpith. From such wood these men carve the cleveresthoptoads, in which the alternate strata of black ridge and uncharred pith aremade to look like a frog's skin with warts. Tourists seem to love these frogs,but I find the damned things repulsive, a reductio ad absurdum of the Japaneselove of wood which is here so appealingly expressed by Shima.1


Shima's commentary:
I have worked with the bird motif ever since 1 first took up prints. In the composition of the present print I treated the birds as still-life objects. I am not completely satisfied with this print because of its small size.2

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation:
This calligraphic design by Maki is for several reasons an appropriate capstone to this book. For one thing, it demonstrates rather clearly the manner in which the younger artists are adapting the oldest techniques to their particular needs. [Maki]. . . gains much force by utilizing three different qualities of black: the traditional solid black in the upright stroke; a medium-force black in the lower horizontal stroke; and a handsomely mottled semi-gray black in the upper curved stroke. This wide contrast yields a most pleasing effect, and the eye is constantly lured from one of the variations to the other.
A second deviation from old patterns is Maki's skillful use of three different textures of wood: the traditional solid, unblemished printing of the upright; the striking vertical graining of the lower horizontal; and the pleasing delicate mottling of the upper curve. Again, these textures carry the eye from one part of the design to the next, and when the variation in texture is wedded to the basic variation in the value of the black, a constant movement of symbol is attained, a kind of stately minuet of black and texture as forst one shape and the next takes command of the eye. Study the print for some minutes and watch this persuasive dance begin.

The third innovation is, of course, the most important. This concerns Maki's skilled use of the calligraphic symbol as the subject matter of art. In the contest several artists submitted prints constructed from calligraphic designs: some were marvelous free-flowing constructions in which the ideographs which Japan originally borrowed from China stood out conspicuously; others were bold utilizations of ideographic elements but without quite forming specific ideographs that could be identified; still others were abstractions which contained the merest suggestion of a calligraphic base.

The decision was finally made in favor of the present Maki. . . because its symbol was clearly derived from calligraphy yet so subtly modified as to free it from an obvious bondage. Furthermore, the symbol was used in such a controlled manner, both in coloring-texture and in disposition, as to remind the viewer that this was a work of conscious art.1


Maki himself offers the below commentary:
This print is based upon the character 牛, meaning cow or ox. I have here tried to give our cultural heritage of such ideographs a modern feel, but in an Oriental style. This meant trying to capture the typically Japanese expression of the beauty of space, the sense of reverence for and persistent pursuit of boundless space, while at the same time taking advantage of the boundary provided by the beauty and life of the paper itself. The beauty of sumi, in it monochrome black, penetrates to the back of the paper and forbids decorative exaggeration or irrelevancies. This effect combines with a succinct and straightforward approach to create a space and an expression that, though intentionally compact, still have a quiet and gentle spread. The two small red seals are an integral part of the composition, providing color and a focal point and thus making the impersonality of the sumi's space deeper and wider and warmer.2

One of 118 prints in the series Dai Nippon Bussan Zue (Products of Greater Japan), issued in August 1877 to coincide with the opening of Japan’s first National Industrial Exposition (Naikoku Kangyō Hakurankai) held in Tokyo’s Ueno Park. In this print, kuzu (Japanese arrowroot or pueraria) is being processed into starch.  Yamato Province (大和国, Yamato no Kuni) was a province of Japan, located in Kinai, corresponding to present-day Nara Prefecture in Honshū.1

Kuzu root is the traditional medicine of choice for a host of digestive disorders and it is also used as a cooking starch.

The top print appears to be an earlier printing as the lines are crisper and the print holds more detail.  Small color changes have been made in the later edition below it, e.g. color of the roof, addition of reddish sunset in the background.

ihl-1732,,CN,c. 1912-1940,1912,"Fan Design River Hut, Boat and Mountains",c. 1912-1940,anonymous,,,"Fan design samples were created as marketing tools for deluxe fan makers.  While the fan design samples below were likely created in the Taishō and early Shōwa eras (c. 1912-1940), fan design samples date back to the Meiji era. They showed the season's available designs, commissioned from some of the most eminent artists of the day. Once the season was over, the sample fans and books of fans were sold. Most of the samples in my collection do not carry a signature or seal and the artists will be forever unknown, but some famous names do appear on several of the prints, such as the below prints Fish and Reeds, designed by Fukuda Heihachirō [福田平八郎 (1892-1974)], a nihonga painter who was awarded the Order of Culture, and Leaping Fish designed by Yokoyama Taikan [横山大観 (1868-1958)], another famous nihonga artist and Order of Culture winner.  

The designs range from Art Deco to traditional genre scenes.

The shape of these prints indicate they were designs for folding fans (sensu 扇子, or ōgi 扇 as they are also known.)  While often described as ""woodblock prints"", I believe most of these sample designs are hand painted or inked rather than printed, as on at least one sample a brush hair is embedded in the ink/paint and on several others the ink or paint has overlapped the paper edge and bled onto the back of the paper.

Some of the prints carry inventory numbers; some bear a cartouche with the word nambu (literally, ""southern region"" and possibly the name of a company) written in kanji 南部 or kana なんぶ, and some bear a fan-shaped cartouche with the kanji character 業 (""karma"" or simply the character for ""industry"" or ""business"") inside it, possibly the trademark of another fan company.

Tuttle Company, Tokyo",Reika Iwami (pencil signature lower right bottom margin followed by date),"One of ten modern prints by ten different artists chosen for James Michener’s 1962 seminal work and portfolio of prints The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation, a work that brought Shima and the other artists to international attention.

James A. Michener's Description from the book The Modern Japanese Print: An Appreciation 

This print is special in many ways.  First of all, it was done my Miss Iwami Reika, the first woman in the history of Japanese prints, so far as I know, to attain full stature.  It is true that Hokusai's daughter, an extraordinary girl known by the name of Chin-chin because her protruding jaw reminded one of the Pekinese dog (called chin in Japanese), issued a few works that gained wide circulation in the middle years of the nineteenth century; but she was never really much more than a curiosity, and her work was in no way commendable.  It is also true that today there are other fine women print artists who are gaining increasing recognition - Shima Tamami and Yoshida Chizuko, to name only two - and that there are now enough of them to have an informal association and to hold periodic exhibits of considerable worth.  But Miss Iwami represents the vanguard, and for two women to win prizes in a competition such as the present one signalizes a triumph of no small proportion.  It has never been easy for women to attain prominence in Japanese art, and for two such young ones to have done so is indeed an accomplishment.

More important, artistically, however, is the second fact: this print exhibits a mastery of texture and color that is enviable.  The utilization of wood grain in the three standing pillars is very satisfying and gives the print a surcharge of emotion.  The printing of this passage and also of the background grays is first rate, skillful overprinting being used to bring out unanticipated textures.  In others of her prints, Miss Iwami uses a striking palette of burnt orange, crisp yellow, and flashing red.  Here she is more subdued, but her vivid sense of color values nevertheless expresses itself in the telling slash of red across the moon.

The third reason why this print has a special significance in this series is that it exemplifies rather handsomely the best effects that are being obtained by the nonrepresentational artists in simplifying subject matter to the ultimate.  What more need by said about winter in Japan, where the wonderful texture of the unpainted wooden houses stands so starkly against the cold sky?  The resulting patterns are most satisfying, emotionally, and many people who have had an opportunity to live closely with others of Miss Iwami's prints can testify to the subtle gratifications one discovers in having them around.  They are somehow right; both the eye and the mind find them recurrently pleasing, and thus they satisfy one of the great purposes of art: they remind us of how simple the most effective measures usually are.  Miss Iwami utilizes simple means, simple design, simple, bold coloring, and out of this produces a complex, sophisticated whole that has the capacity to please without cloying.

The final characteristic of this print that makes it special for me is that it was done by an artist whom I had the pleasure of helping discover.  All the men represented in this book were well-established performers before I came on the Tokyo scene.  Hiratsuka was producing fine prints before I was born, and Maekawa too.  Azechi was well into his third period - the portraits of mountaineers against stylized peaks - before I met him; and each of the other artists was well known.  But Iwami Reika was not.1",H x W Image IHL Cat. #895: 15 3/4 x 10 3/4 in. ( 40 x 27.3 cm) IHL Cat. #1336g: 15 3/4 x 10 3/4 in. ( 40 x 27.3 cm),H x W Paper IHL Cat. #895: 17 1/4 x 12 1/8 in.
