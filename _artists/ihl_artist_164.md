At an early age, Yonejirō was sent to live with his uncle, a successful pharmacist.&nbsp; In 1850, at the age of eleven, his uncle enrolled him as a resident student in the school of Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1798-1861), one of the most successful woodblock print designers in Edo and one of its more colorful characters.&nbsp; As was customary, Kuniyoshi gave Yonejirō a new name, Yoshitoshi, derived from the second character of Kuniyoshi's name.&nbsp; Kuniyoshi took a special interest in Yoshitoshi allowing him access to his personal collection of foreign prints and engravings. &nbsp;</span></p> <p style="text-align:left">In 1853, at the age of fourteen, Yoshitoshi composed his first woodblock print - a triptych of the naval battle of Dannoura in which the Minamoto clan destroyed the forces of the Taira clan in 1185. That same year, US Commodore Perry arrived with a fleet of battleships and forced Japan to open its door to the West.&nbsp;</p> <h4 style="clear:both"><a name="TOC-2"></a></h4> <p style="text-align:left">Kuniyoshi's death in 1861, left the 22 year old Yoshitoshi struggling to make a living.&nbsp; In 1863, Yoshitoshi's natural father died.&nbsp; <br /> </p> <h4 style="text-align:left"><a name="TOC-Yonejiro-Becomes-Yoshitoshi-"></a>Yonejiro Becomes Yoshitoshi (芳年)<br /> </h4> <p style="text-align:left">After his father's death, Yoshitoshi began to sign some of his prints <i>Tsukioka Yoshitoshi</i>, claiming a rather vague relationship between his uncle's family and the Tsukioka family, which had produced the eighteenth-century Osaka painter, Tsukioka Settei.&nbsp; In that same year a daughter, who died a year later, was born to Yoshitoshi.&nbsp; (The name of Yoshitoshi's wife at that time is unknown.)</p> <h4 style="text-align:left"><a name="TOC-Political-and-Civil-Unrest"></a><b>Political and Civil Unrest</b><br /> </h4> <p style="text-align:left">Yoshitoshi's formative years were lived in a period of great unrest.&nbsp; The continuing encroachment of Westerners and Western ideas through the 1850s and 1860s had a profoundly unsettling effect on a feudal and very closed Japanese society.&nbsp; While popular sentiment was very anti-Western there were those who realized that the only defense against the West was to adopt its superior military and economic technology. The tension between rejecting Western influence and embracing Western technology, coupled with crop failures, economic recession and hyper-inflation shook the ruling Tokugawa shogunate (which had ruled since 1603) to its foundations.&nbsp; This instability lead to armed conflict between the Tokugawa shogunate (which held power in the name of the emperor, but exercised independent and almost absolute control over all policy) and competing aristocrats and samurai who wanted to install a more modern government under the guise of restoring the emperor to his rightful role. This war culminated in the 1868 overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate government and its replacement by a more modern government which proclaimed an imperial restoration and a new era of <i>Meiji </i>("Enlightened Rule").&nbsp; Stevenson notes that the impact of Yoshitoshi's witnessing the bloody massacre of two thousand shogun troops by the well-armed forces of the emperor at the end of the civil war "reverberated through Yoshitoshi's work for many years."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <h4 style="text-align:left"><a name="TOC-Disturbing-Images"></a>Disturbing Images<br /> </h4> <p style="text-align:left">Between 1866 and 1868 Yoshitoshi produced a number of gruesome and sadistic designs in a series called <i>Twenty-eight Murders with Verse</i>. &nbsp;These prints, several of which show the stabbing or decapitation of women, were quite popular both in Japan and the West, and sold well.&nbsp; John Stevenson, in his seminal wo<font size="2">rk</font><font size="2">, <i>One Hundred Aspects of the Moon</i>, states that "the notoriety of the violence in Yoshitoshi's work is justified to the extent</font> that he did design shocking images more effectively than any other print maker.&nbsp; However, the emphasis that modern critics and galleries place on his bloody prints gives a false perspective to his work ... [and] does not give an accurate impression of the subtlety, insight, and integrity of the bulk of Yoshitoshi's designs."<br /> </p> <h4 style="text-align:left;clear:both"><a name="TOC-Depression-and-Resurrection"></a>Depression and Resurrection<br /> </h4> <p style="text-align:left">At the time of the Meiji Restoration, Yoshitoshi was achieving a measure of success, with over 240 prints published in 1868 and 1869.&nbsp; A newspaper ranked him fourth in a list of woodblock print artists and his name was included in a popular guidebook to Tokyo.&nbsp; However, by the middle of 1869 his print output slowed to a trickle and did not pick up until the end of 1871, although he did maintain his studio and pupils.&nbsp; As Stevenson states, "perhaps Yoshitoshi's inspiration had been exhausted by the trauma of the recent past."</p> <p style="text-align:left">Towards the end of 1871, Yoshitoshi started to received commissions, producing several series, but by the next year he had fallen into a deep depression.&nbsp; While he continued to teach, he did not produce prints again until the end of 1872.&nbsp; By the end of 1873 he had worked his way out of his depression and produced two triptychs which he signed with a new artist name, <i>Taiso </i>(<span style="line-height:16.6666660308838px;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent">大蘇)</span><i style="line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent">, </i><span style="line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent">or "Great Resurrection."&nbsp;</span></p> <h4 style="text-align:left"><a name="TOC-The-Satsuma-Rebellion"></a><b>The Satsuma Rebellion</b></h4> <p style="text-align:left"> In 1877 political events again changed Yoshitoshi's fortunes. With the dismantling of the feudal system, the samurai found their livelihood and values under attack, with the most egregious attack being the 1876 edict prohibiting the wearing of a sword, the quintessential symbol of the samurai, by anyone except members of the conscript army.&nbsp; Samurai resentment culminated in the <a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/articles/satsuma-rebellion-prints">Satsuma Rebellion</a> led by the aristocrat Saigo Takamori, a hero to many Japanese who regarded him as a symbol of the values of the samurai class.&nbsp; After meeting with initial success, his forces were pushed back by the imperial troops to a hillside near Kagoshima and made a final stand. In this final battle, 60,000 government forces faced 40,000 rebels resulting in 16,000 casualties for the government and 20,000 casualties for the rebels.&nbsp; Saigo was wounded and later committed <i>seppuku</i>.</p> <p style="text-align:left">The Satsuma Rebellion provided a boom to newspapers and publishers commissioned woodblock print artists to design pictures of the events.&nbsp; Yoshitoshi was literally flooded with commissions, designing prints for at least nine different publishers.&nbsp; These prints brought Yoshitoshi both public recognition and moderate wealth.&nbsp; (See the prin<font size="2">t </font><font size="1"><font size="2"><a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/artists/yoshitoshi-tsukioka-1839---1892-/illustration-of-the-navy-landing-at-sukuchi-village"><i>Illustration of the Navy Landing at Sukuchi Village</i></a> in this collection.)</font><br /></font></p> <p style="text-align:left">For additional information on prints of the Satsuma Rebellion see the article&nbsp;<i><a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/articles/satsuma-rebellion-prints">Satsuma Rebellion Prints</a></i> on this website.</p> <h4 style="text-align:left"><a name="TOC-Newspaper-Work"></a>Newspaper Work</h4> <font size="1"> <div style="text-align:left"> <span style="background-color:transparent">Source: </span> <i style="background-color:transparent">Yoshitoshi The Splendid Decadent, </i> <span style="background-color:transparent">Shinichi Segi, Kodansha International, 1985 p. 49.</span> </div></font> <p style="text-align:left">As an additional source of income Yoshitoshi took on newspaper illustration and began creating topical prints for Tokyo's <i>Postal News</i> in early 1875.&nbsp; The demand for his work grow with the popularity of his Satsuma Rebellion prints creating demand from other newspapers for his artwork and around 1880 he began working for Tokyo's <i>Illustrated Liberal Newspaper </i>(<i>E-iri Jyu Shinmbun</i>).&nbsp; Yoshitoshi's salary at the <i>Illustrated </i>started at "a salary of 40 yen a month, a tidy sum in those days, plus transportation to and from the editorial offices in a pedicab bearing the Tsukioka family crest.&nbsp; Later, the stipend was to rise to 100 yen a month, with twenty shares of stock and a <i>jinrikisha</i> into the bargain."&nbsp; His newspaper work paid far more than the typical five or ten yen he would received for even his best designs.<br /></p> <h4 style="text-align:left"><a name="TOC-Students"></a>Students<br /></h4> <p style="text-align:left">Yoshitoshi's atelier, with more than eighty students, was the major conduit through which training in the <i>ukiyo-e</i> style was passed to the next generation.&nbsp; One of his most famous students was his adopted son K<a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/artists/tsukioka-kogyo-1869-1927">ō</a>gyo who was to become the artist <a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/artists/tsukioka-kogyo-1869-1927">Tsukioka Kōgyo (1869-1927)</a>. <br /></p> <p style="text-align:left"> The young K<a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/artists/tsukioka-kogyo-1869-1927">ō</a>gyo studied with Yoshitoshi as did many other young, and some older, aspiring artists.&nbsp; A stone monument erected to Yoshitoshi's memory in 1889 lists fifty-nine students and Stevenson cites a source claiming that Yoshitoshi taught over two hundred students during his lifetime.&nbsp; In addition to his adopted son Tsukioka Kōgyo, other well-known artists he taught include <a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/artists/takeuchi-keishu-1861-1942-">Takeuchi Keishū (1861-1942)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/artists/migata-toshihide-1863-1925" style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">Migata Toshihide (1863-1925)</a><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">, Goto Toshikage (act. c. 1868-1892), who created a memorial portrait of his teacher inscribed with Yoshitoshi's death poem (see below), and </span><a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/artists/mizuno-toshikata-1866-1908-" style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">Mizuno Toshikata (1866-1908)</a><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">, who Yoshitoshi designated to succeed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In early 1891 he invited friends to a gathering of artists that did not actually exist. His physical condition also deteriorated, and his misfortune was compounded when all of his money was stolen in a robbery of his home. After more symptoms, he was admitted to a mental hospital. He eventually left the hospital&nbsp;in May 1892, but did not return home, instead renting rooms.</p> <p style="text-align:left">He died three weeks later in a rented room, on June 9, 1892, from a cerebral hemorrhage. He was 53 years old. A stone memorial monument to Yoshitoshi was built in Higashi-okubo, Tokyo, in 1898.</p> <dl> <dd style="text-align:left"> <i>yo o tsumete</i> </dd> <dt style="text-align:left"> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i>terimasarishi wa</i> </dt> <dd style="text-align:left"> <i>natsu no tsuki</i> </dd> <dt style="text-align:left"> <br /> </dt> <dd style="text-align:left"> holding back the night </dd> <dd style="text-align:left"> with its increasing brilliance </dd> <dd style="text-align:left"> the summer moon </dd> <dd style="text-align:left"> -- Yoshitoshi's death poem </dd> </dl> <h4 style="text-align:left"><a name="TOC-Retrospective-observations"></a><span>Retrospective Observations</span></h4> <p style="text-align:left">During his life Yoshitoshi produced many series of prints, and a large number of triptychs, many of great merit. Two of his three best-known series, the <a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/articles/one-hundred-aspects-of-the-moon"><i>One Hundred Aspects of the Moon</i></a> and <i>New Forms of Thirty-Six Ghosts</i>, contain numerous masterpieces. The third, <i>Thirty-Two Aspects of Customs and Manners</i>, was for many years the most highly regarded of his work, but does not now have that same status. Other less-common series also contain many fine prints, including <i>Famous Generals of Japan</i>, <i>A Collection of Desires</i>, <i>New Selection of Eastern Brocade Pictures</i>, and <i>Lives of Modern People</i>.</p> <p style="text-align:left">While demand for his prints continued for a few years, eventually interest in him waned, both in Japan and around the world. The canonical view in this period was that the generation of Hiroshige (1797-1858) was really the last of the great woodblock artists, and more traditional collectors stopped even earlier, at the generation of Utamaro (1753-1806) and Toyokuni (1769-1825.)</p> <p style="text-align:left">However, starting in the 1970s, interest in him resumed, and reappraisal of his work has shown the quality, originality and genius of the best of it, and the degree to which he succeeded in keeping the best of the old Japanese woodblock print, while pushing the field forward by incorporating both new ideas from the West, as well as his own innovations.</p> <h4 style="text-align:left"><a name="TOC-The-Importance-of-Yoshitoshi-s-Prints"></a>The Importance of Yoshitoshi’s Prints <br /> </h4> <p

style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">, the lines and compositions of Yoshitoshi’s prints are full of energy.&nbsp; The style was well-suited to expressing inner emotional states, subjects which Japanese artist had not previously explored, partly because of lack of suitably expressive style, partly because of lack of interest.&nbsp; Yoshitoshi did not lack interest.&nbsp; He was able to portray the inner states of the wide variety of people he described in his prints because of his emotional involvement with their stories and predicaments, their doubts and victories.&nbsp; He related passionately to what he saw and learned.&nbsp; He empathized, he cared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> </div> <div style="text-align:left"> <br /> </div> <div style="text-align:left">
