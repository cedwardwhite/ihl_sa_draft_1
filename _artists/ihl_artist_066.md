Kiyochika, it is said, described himself as working in the style of Iwasa Matabei (1578-1650) and Hishikawa Moronobu (c. 1618-1694) two of the founders of <a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/articles/print-genres---ukiyo-e-shin-hanga-sosaku-hanga">ukiyo-e</a>. <br /> <br /> There is speculation that Kiyochika was introduced to Charles Wirgman (1832-1891), an English journalist and art instructor, and that he studied Japanese painting with <a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/artists/kawanabe-kyosai-1831-1889-">Kawanabe Kyōsai (1831-1889)</a> <sup>1</sup>, but the evidence is inconclusive, again leaving Kiyochika as likely being a self-taught artist.&nbsp; It is also reported that he studied photography with Shimo'oka Renjo (1823-1914), the father of Japanese photography. <br /> <br /> Kiyochika was unique at his time for not having any allegiance to a master or school of art.&nbsp; Had he been born prior to the Meiji era and the new freedoms it brought, he would have been forced into a master-disciple relationship to pursue an artistic career. <br /> <br /> <h4><a name="TOC-Early-Woodblock-Prints:-The-Series-Famous-Views-of-Tokyo-Tokyo-meisho-1876-1881"></a>Early Woodblock Prints: The Series Famous Views of Tokyo (Tokyo meisho) 1876-1881</h4> In 1876, working with the publisher Matsuki Heikichi [who also published many of <a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/artists/yoshitoshi-tsukioka-1839---1892-">Yoshitoshi Tsukioka's (1839-1892)</a>&nbsp;prints], the print&nbsp; <i>View of Rainfall on Shin-ou-hashi in To-kei</i>&nbsp;was published. &nbsp;It was to be the first of 93 prints in the series <i>Famous Views of Tokyo</i> ( <i>Tokyo Meisho-zu.)</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;This, and subsequent, prints in the series employed Western style perspective and realistically portrayed the effects of light and shadows in a style called <i>kosenga </i>(luminous images).&nbsp; Henry D. Smith II, a biographer of Kiyochika's, describes the series as follows: <br /> &nbsp; <table border="1" bordercolor="#888888" cellspacing="0" style="border-color:rgb(136,136,136);border-width:1px;border-collapse:collapse"> <tbody> <tr> <td style="width:388px;height:369px">&nbsp;<font size="1">Source: <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/%7Ehds2/pdf/1991b_Meiji_Tokyo_Seen_by_Kiyochika.pdf"><i>Meiji Tokyo as Seen by Kiyochika</i>, Henry D.

Smith suggests that the reason for the stoppage was that the prints were not selling as "his public had become jaded by his westernized style" and the later prints in the <i>Famous Views of Tokyo</i> series were "conventional and unimaginative." <sup>2</sup>&nbsp; <br /> <br /> <h4><a name="TOC-Working-as-a-Satirist"></a>Working as a Satirist</h4> To earn a living Kiyochika turned to a career drawing political cartoons, aided by Hara Taneaki (1853-1942), a former shogunal retainer turned Christian book seller, who published Kiyochika's comic series of woodblocks <i>Thirty-Two Faces</i> in 1882.&nbsp;

</i> <br /> <br /> In 1883 Kiyochika married Tajima Yoshiko who had one daughter and was pregnant with a second.&nbsp; In 1886 he moved his family near the offices of the major newspapers.&nbsp; Kiyochika's last daughter Katsu, who was to become her father's biographer, was born in November 1894, during the height of the <a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/articles/war-prints-senso-e-/sino-japanese-war-1894---1895-">Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895)</a>. <br /> <br /> <h4><a name="TOC-Senso-e-War-Prints-of-the-Sino-Japanese-War"></a>Senso-e (War Prints) of the Sino-Japanese War</h4> The patriotism engendered by the war drove a strong demand for battle illustrations and Kiyochika churned out hundreds of battle-scene triptychs and single-sheet battle scenes and war-related comic prints, such as the series <a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/artists/kiyochika-kobayashi-1847-1915-/long-live-japan-one-hundred-victories-one-hundred-laughs-"><i>Long Live Japan: One Hundred Victories and One Hundred Laughs</i>.&nbsp;

"These prints partly imitated Hiroshige’s <i>One Hundred Famous Views of Edo</i>, but they have a very complicated relationship with their predecessor.&nbsp; The use of the vertical format is similar, as is the use of a close-up view against which is juxtaposed a faraway view.&nbsp; There is, however, a particularly conscious attempt on Kiyochika’s part to demonstrate how the city had been subject to Westernization." <sup>3</sup> For an example, see the print <a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/artists/kiyochika-kobayashi-1847-1915-/meguro-arsenal-from-the-series-one-hundred-views-of-musashi"><i>Meguro Arsenal</i>, IHL Cat. #610.</a> <br /> </div> <div> <b><br />Famous Views of Tokyo</b> <br /> In 1896, twenty years after designing the first print in the series <i>Famous Views of Tokyo, </i>Kiyochika designed 28 prints as part of the series <i>Views of the Famous Sights of Japan.&nbsp;

<br /> <h4><a name="TOC-Hard-Times"></a>Hard Times</h4> In 1899, after the death of one of his daughters, Kiyochika began a series of travels in the provinces which concluded in 1900 when he again turned to illustration work with the <i>Niroku shinpo</i>, a political newspaper.&nbsp; While working at the paper fraud charges were brought against him for accepting money to suppress a series of critical articles about a distant family relation of his wife.&nbsp; Kiyochika was forced to resign from the paper and three difficult years followed until the start of the <a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/articles/war-prints-senso-e-/russo-japanese-war-prints"> Russo-Japanese War in 1904</a> when publisher's again asked for designs of battle prints.&nbsp; However, by 1904 woodblock prints were already in decline as the new western technologies of lithography and photography fed the public's desire for realistic depictions of battle scenes, and times remained difficult for Kiyochika and his family.&nbsp; In 1906 he and his family moved to Fujimi-cho, a former district for retainers of the shogun.&nbsp; In 1913, after the death of his wife Yoshiko, Kiyochika traveled again, making sketches for his final landscape series commissioned by Matsuki Heikichi and published after his death.&nbsp; He returned to his home in October of 1915 where he died on November 28th. <br /> <br /> <div style="margin-left:80px"> <table border="0" bordercolor="#888888" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse;border-color:rgb(136,136,136);border-width:0px"> <tbody> <tr> <td style="width:189px;height:315px">&nbsp;

Mokutaro, along with the writers Nagai Kufu (1879-1959) and Yone Noguchi (1875-1947) wrote about Kiyochika's art and sparked a rediscovery of the artist that continues until this day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Noguchi's article <a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/articles/kiyochika-kobayashi-a-modern-master-of-the-japanese-color-print-by-yone-noguchi"><i>Kiyochika Kobayashi: A Modern Master of the Japanese Color Print</i></a> written shortly after Kiyochika's death is reproduced in the <a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/articles">Article section</a> of this site. <br /> <br /> <h4><a name="TOC-Kiyochika-s-Students"></a>Kiyochika's Students</h4> Despite Kiyochika's independence from any art lineage and disinterest in creating his own lineage, he did open his own art school in 1894 and take on several students.&nbsp; Two of his students, <a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/artists/inoui-yasuji-1864-1889">Inoue Yasuji (1864 - 1889)</a> and <a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/artists/taguchi-beisaku-1864-1903-">Taguchi Beisaku (1864-1903)</a>, became well known designers of woodblock prints.&nbsp; Of the two, Yasuji was the most influenced by his master, copying his style to the extent that much of his work is almost identical to Kiyochika's.&nbsp; Beisaku, who was a later student of Kiyochika's, is primarily known for designing artistic war triptychs that showed an innovative use of color and tone. &nbsp;The <i>shin&nbsp;hanga</i> artist <a href="http://www.myjapanesehanga.com/home/artists/tsuchiya-koitsu-1870-1949">Tsuchiya Kōitsu (1870-1949)</a>&nbsp;was part of Kiyochika’s household from about 1886 to 1900 and one can see Kiyochika's influence on his student's landscape prints. &nbsp;&nbsp;

unprecedented in the history of Japanese art, and at the time could have only have been used by those working in a purely Western style of painting..."&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Tokyo landcapes, he usually signed horizontally, often from left to right in the Western manner.&nbsp; He often appended <i>hitsu</i> (from the brush of) [or <i>ga </i>(drawn by)] to his name, as did many Japanese artists.&nbsp; In 1894 he took a new art name Shinsei <span style="font-weight:normal">真生</span>, written with the kanji for 'truth' and 'birth'.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kiyochika used Shinsei or simply Shin <span style="font-weight:normal">真 </span>for the rest of his life, although after the 1880s it appears on seals and not as part of his signature.&nbsp; In the late 1880s, Kiyochika began to drop the family name, Kobayashi, in his signatures and signed works simply Kiyochika.&nbsp; "In effect, his given name had in time become his art name, and on both paintings and prints from the 1890s until the end of his life, Kiyochika always signed simply 'Kiyochika,' reserving the family name Kobayashi for seals." <br /> <br /> <div style="margin-left:60px"> <table border="1" bordercolor="#888888"
